KANO, Nigeria — Multiple bomb attacks by members of an Islamist sect targeting a church and a police station in Nigeria's troubled city of Maiduguri killed five people on Tuesday, police said.

""There were seven explosions in all,"" police spokesman Lawal Abdullahi told AFP.

He said the attacks were staged by ""gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram"" and ""five people in all were killed and three injured including two policemen.""

Four explosions went off at Gwange police station, two at Dandal police station while the seventh bomb exploded beside a Catholic church, he said.

Explosive devices were hurled into the premises of Gwange police station but did not cause any casualties.

But gunbattles broke out between the police and the attackers ""in which the police succeeded in killing three of the gunmen,"" he said. Two policemen were injured in the shootout.

""In the second attack another group of sect members hurled a bomb apparently targeting St Patrick's (Catholic) church, but missed the target and it landed on the street outside,"" said Abdullahi.

It went off and killed two passers-by and injured another.

Another bomb went off near the same church last week but with no casualties.

Several rounds of gunshots rang across the city's major square and parade ground, Ramat Square in downtown Maiduguri sending people scampering for cover. But police said they were responsible for the shots aimed at scaring off Boko Haram from carrying out further attacks.

On Monday a gunman killed a Wahabbi cleric and imam of a mosque in Biu town who was critical of Boko Haram ideology especially its rejection of Western education and its resort to violence, his neighbours said.

Ibrahim Birkuti was shot by a motorcycle-riding gunman thought to be a member of Boko Haram sect outside his house in Biu, 2OO kilometres (120 miles) south of Maiduguri, which is in Borno state.

The sect which launched an uprising in 2009 has been blamed for dozens of killings in the northeast where it targets security forces, community leaders and government institutions.

A man claiming to be a spokesman for Boko Haram told the BBC Hausa service last week that the sect was responsible for attacks that killed 18 people mainly in the northern state of Bauchi following the inauguration of President Goodluck Jonathan.

But the recently-elected Borno state governor Kashim Shettima told reporters that not only Boko Haram was behind all the attacks in Maiduguri.

""There are those involved in banditry, others involved in political thuggery and some by Boko Haram,"" he said on Tuesday.

""For instance we have found an exhibit which shows that there is the hand of an opposition political party in the attack that was launched at Dandal police station.""

The blasts were believed to have planted by the members of the dreaded Boko Haram at a Catholic Cathedral located in the heart of Maiduguri city.

The church, St Patrick Catholic Church was being attacked twice by the sect within five days.

Security sources told Xinhua on Tuesday that the newly swore in governor of the state, Kashim Shettima had just passed the area barely 20 minutes when the incident occurred.

The police sources said the bombers stormed the church gate in a Honda car at about 2.30 p.m. local time apparently to blow off the church but they were unlucky as one of the bombs exploded killing the three occupants and two passers-by.

Yunusa Adams, a cab driver who almost ran into the blast, told Xinhua that the bomber had succeeded in throwing the explosive into the church premises before another one exploded in their car.

""They threw the bomb into the church premises and the thing went off while another one exploded in the car simultaneously,"" he added.

At another location within the city, some gunmen suspected to be of Boko Haram laid siege on Gwange Police Stations with another explosion.

Police sources said the men had exhibited some measure of courage at the station as they engaged the police in a gun battle after throwing an explosion into the station.

""They started shooting into the police station perhaps to destabilize us but we organized ourselves in a way and engaged them in a shoot out, killing three of them,"" a police source told Xinhua.

Xinhua's reporter in Maiduguri, the state capital said two passers-by were hit by stray bullet during the encounter between the police and the Boko Haram men while 14 people were wounded.

Hospital officials at the Accident and Emergency Unit of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) told Xinhua that about 10 corpses and 14 injured persons were brought to the unit on Tuesday evening.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) responsible for disaster and emergency management in Nigeria said it has evacuated the corpses at the scenes of the blast and deposited them at the UMTH morgue. The agency however did not give the statistics of casualties, saying it was not necessary for now.

State police spokesperson Abdullahi Lawal told reporters that five people died in the incident.

""In all, there were a total of five dead including three Boko Haram men shot by our gallant officers and men at Gwange Police Station while two persons also died at the St Patrick blast,"" he added.

According to him, the police recovered a vehicle used by the gun men at Gwange Police Station, an AK 47 rifle and three handsets.

He assured that the police were more alert than before and determined to protect the lives and properties of the people."

Nigeria : Boko Haram Strikes Again, Kills Six Policemen in Katsina - Lagos Assembly Approves N700 Million for Armoured Personnel Carriers

Boko Haram struck again on Monday night in Kankara town, Katsina State, killing six policemen and one civilian in a bomb blast at a police station.

Among the dead was the Divisional Police Officer (DPO). Even Lagos, one of Nigeria's safest states, is now on edge.

To calm the nerves, the state Assembly on Monday approved N700 million for the 10 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) Governor Babatunde Fashola requested for the police to upgrade security and ward off the likes of Boko Haram jidahists now on the rampage in Abuja and beyond up North.

A member of the Islamic sect last Thursday detonated the country's first suicide bomb in Abuja, which he intended to kill the Inspector General of Police, Rafiz Ringim.

He could not get Ringim, but several others died, including the bomber and his two female accomplices, and over 74 vehicles were set ablaze.

Before the Lagos Assembly approved the N700 million, a member, Mudashiru Obasa, wondered why it should be sourced from the Local Government Intervention Fund (LGIF), suggesting that it should be taken from the State Security Trust Fund (SSTF).

""If the fund is taken from the LGIF, it would affect development in all local governments in the state,"" he argued.

Bisi Yussuf noted that if APCs are purchased and the roads are bad, the tanks will have no access to patrol.

""The LGIF is meant for the development of every local government,"" he added, ""so if you take money from the LGIF and use it to procure APCs and the roads are bad, it is as good as useless.

""We can't deduct from the money meant for the development of infrastructure.""

Others, including Lanre Oshun and Wahab Alawiye-King, differed, maintaining that security is paramount nationwide, particularly now that Boko Haram is on the loose, and is pretty deadly.

Deputy Speaker Taiwo Kolawole counselled that ""Due to the security situation in the country, I think we should allow this to go, but we must at the same time prevent a future occurrence.""

Speaker Adeyemi Ikuforiji said the approval should be seen as a donation to the police to protect lives and property, an intervention by the state government.

""In the spirit of one secure Lagos, I would suggest that since this is the first request from the executive arm, and due to the promise we made that we will support the arm, we approve the money,"" Ikuforiji stressed.

His appeal was heeded.

Security was beefed up at the Assembly complex upon the resumption of the legislators from a two-week holiday.

An Assembly source narrated: ""We all saw what happened at police headquarters in Abuja last week where (Ringim) was almost affected.

""That implies that nowhere is safe and we cannot afford to allow such to be perpetrated here.""

Private security agents employed to replace Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officials conducted checks on visitors.

Vehicles were searched and their owners registered before they were allowed to drive in.

However, President Goodluck Jonathan on Monday reassured Nigerians that Abuja will contain terrorism and keep the country safe.

He was reacting to concerns raised by members of the late Tafawa Balewa family who visited him at the Villa.

Jonathan said the explosion at police headquarters was an act of terror, which has become a global trend, but assured that the government will take steps to ensure the safety of all Nigerians.

He promised that no incident will be overlooked, no matter the circumstances or location.

He welcomed the appreciation expressed by the Tafawa Balewa family for naming the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs building after the late Prime Minister, which he said is a recognition of Balewa's contribution as Nigeria's first Foreign Minister.

""It is important that great leaders are appreciated,"" Jonathan stated.

He advised the family to appoint people of integrity to manage the proposed Balewa Foundation so as to keep his good name alive.

He said Balewa's mausoleum will be upgraded to a suitable tourist attraction for foreign leaders and other visitors.

Yakubu, the eldest son of Balewa, explained that the delegation came to condole with Jonathan over the death of fellow Nigerians who died in the bomb blast last Thursday and to thank him for naming the Foreign Affairs Ministry building after their patriarch.

He urged the government to dig below the surface to tackle terrorism.

""The question should be what is or are the causes and why? The answers you get will enable you to know the next step to take to tackle the problem.

""Remember, it is not only Boko Haram that is the problem facing this nation. There are a lot of problems, including poverty and unemployment,"" Yakubu told Jonathan.

Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG) went further by stressing that the attack rode on the backs of weak leadership and the failure to tackle insecurity.

ARG Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, expressed concern that the country is becoming a terrorist state in an orgy of senseless deaths of innocent citizens, who have even become targets of suicide bombers.

He urged Jonathan to rise up to the challenge and protect the country.

Said Odumakin: ""It is unfortunate and saddening that Nigeria is fast degenerating into a terrorist state. The episodic recurrences of bomb blasts are beginning to instill fear in Nigerians, which is very unhealthy for the nation.

""There must be sustained and coordinated efforts to get to the root of these dastardly acts.

""It is time for this government to wake up from slumber, it is time for this government to rise to the challenge of leadership, and it must be held responsible by Nigerians for not only security insensitivity but the failure to provide good leadership that will assure the safety of all Nigerians.""

Northern Governors' Forum (NGF) Chairman and Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu condemned the bomb blast and described Boko Haram members as cowards.

A statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Danladi Ndayebo, insisted that, ""It is an act of cowardice for anyone to derive joy in killing, maiming of innocent people and destruction of public property, which never brings any good, but rather brings setbacks to the society.""

Aliyu urged the security agents to investigate and bring to book all the masterminds.

But National Democratic Forum (NDF) President, Jonathan Vatsa, suggested dialogue with Boko Haram because of the danger it poses to Nigeria's unity and corporate existence.

For the Boko Haram ""Islamic fundamentalists"" to penetrate police headquarters as part of Ringim's convoy ""shows how organised they are when compared to the security network we have in Nigeria,"" Vasta lamented.

Hamza Idris and Yahaya Ibrahim

Maiduguri — An explosion killed at least 10 people and injured many others yesterday at a bar close to a police barracks in Maiduguri, Borno State, on the day gunmen shot dead the chairman of Jere Local Government Area in the state.

Security authorities confirmed eight deaths in the blast which happened at about 6pm at the Mammy Market, but a man involved in the operation to remove casualties said he counted not less than 10 dead bodies.

Major General Jack Nwaogbo, commander of a joint police and military taskforce in the state, confirmed the blast to Daily Trust by telephone last night. ""I am right now at the scene of the blast. It is a market belonging to the police,"" he said.

Reuters news agency also quoted Major General Nwaogbo as saying, ""Five people have been confirmed dead while 10 others sustained various degrees of injuries.""

Witnesses said the market where beer and other beverages were sold was filled with people including security operatives, as is usually the case on Sundays, when the bomb went off.

Residents of Maiduguri heard a deafening sound followed by thick smoke plumes billowing into the sky. Witnesses said men and women had been killed in the attack which also destroyed many structures and stalls in the market.

""For now, we have counted 10 dead bodies and many injured people. The figure may rise depending on the situation but rescue operation is on-going,"" a man who was among the rescuers told Daily Trust.

No group claimed responsibility of the blast but it was similar to the attacks carried out by the Boko Haram sect, which has been launching series of gun raids and bombings in Maiduguri in the past 12 months.

At least 25 people were killed in a similar attack penultimate Sunday at a tavern in Dala area of Maiduguri.

Earlier yesterday, gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram sect trailed the caretaker chairman of JereLGA, Mustapha Baale, and killed him at the home of his mother around 4pm, along Maideribe Islamiyya School in Maiduguri.

Two of his brothers said the chairman who visited their aged mother was trailed by two gunmen riding a motorcycle. ""They met him in front of the house discussing with some of his friends and shot him in the head severally before they fled,"" one of the brothers said.

Baale was among the caretaker chairmen of the 27 local government areas recently appointed by Governor Kashim Shettima. The late chairman who was in his early 50s was once the elected chairman of the area in 1999 and later became the member of the Borno State House of Assembly. In May, he contested but lost the House of Representatives election on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP).

The attack on the chairman and the Mammy Market came after the killing of some people in three separate attacks late Saturday night at Bulabulin Ngarnam area of Maiduguri.

Residents said up to nine people were killed in the attack but an official of the Task Force on Operation Restore Order (ORO) who spoke in confidence said three people were killed.

Relatives of victims said the gunmen waylaid the area around 11pm and operated till midnight before they fled away.

Among the victims was one Mr. Abba Bala who was trailed to his bedroom.

""We were sleeping inside our compound when a group of three people came into our room and met us sleeping,"" wife of the deceased, a mother of 10, said.""They directed me to go inside the room...and as I moved slowly, I heard gunshots and when I turned back, I saw my husband in the pool of his blood.""

At another house, two brothers were killed by the gunmen. Mr. Simon Umar, an elder brother of the deceased, said the gunmen jumped into their compound around 11.45pm. ""I lost two brothers in the attack. They include ApaguUmar who was a 30-year-old businessman and Sani Umar who was 35 years old. He was a student,"" Mr. Simon said.

""When the gunmen came, they didn't say anything or requested for anything. They shot their targets and left the house without a trace,"" he said.

Spokesman for the military-police task force Col. Victor Ebhalemesaid some arrests were made over the Saturday attacks.

""I can assure you that we are on top of the situation, we have already mobilized our men to flash points but our success heavily relies on information from the general public,"" he added.

Nigeria : Boko Haram Kills Four, Steals N21.5 Million LG Salaries in Borno

Daniel Kanu, Andrew Utulu, Rotimi Akinwumi And Abdulkareem Haruna

Lagos/Abuja/Maiduguri — Boko Haram piled on the pressure with impunity on Monday, killing another four persons and carting off N21.5 million workers' salary in Borno, after its rampage between Saturday and Sunday, in which 12 persons, including a Council Chairman, were murdered and 14 injured.

The disclosure in Abuja by the State Security Service (SSS) that it detected and demobilised 12 bombs in Kaduna in May and June counts for nothing against the arsenal of the fundamentalist Islamic jihadists, who mounted another deadly explosion in Maiduguri on Sunday.

Eight persons were killed and 13 injured in that attack on Sunday, 24 hours before SSS Assistant Director (Public Affairs), Marilyn Ogar, announced the detection of bombs and the arrest of over 100 insurgents in the states of Bauchi, Kaduna, Kano, Yobe, Borno, and Adamawa.

Ogar told a press conference that the SSS arrested ""key cell commanders and members of dissident groups"" but they will not be prosecuted because of the ""carrot and stick"" approach adopted by President Goodluck Jonathan in dealing with Boko Haram.

But that runs counter to the disclosure on Sunday by the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Onyeabo Ihejirika, who said anyone caught with explosives will be prosecuted under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

According to Ogar, the SSS demobilised 12 bombs across Kaduna State in May and June:

- Eight concealed in tins beneath a staircase in Kafanchan on May 23.

-One in Gonin on May 29.

- One in a sack under a kerosene tank on LD Abubakar Road off Kaduna-Abuja Expressway by Central Market in Gonin Gora on June 10.

- One wired to a nine-volt battery under the railway track, behind Dambo International College, Barnawa on June 14.

She added that, ""On June 27, information received from patriotic members of the public assisted in the recovery of some components of yet to be assembled explosives. The items include a camping gas cylinder with a pin, detonating cables, a bottle of distilled water, pliers, masking tape, and clips.

""These were found in a hotel, and meant to be used to bomb a shopping mall in Kaduna.""

Ogar said the names of those arrested will not be disclosed and they will not be prosecuted because Jonathan has reiterated his plan to give the insurgents a second chance to change their ways.

""They are still undergoing the process of de-radicalisation, perception management, and we are also trying to win their confidence back with the society.""

She admitted that stopping militancy is not an easy task, and solicited the help of Nigerians, saying, ""The successes recorded so far can be credited to the patriotism of some concerned members of the public.""

It was also confirmed on Monday that former Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister, Nasir el-Rufai, visited the SSS headquarters in Abuja as ordered.

A statement issued by his media consultant, Muyiwa Adekeye, said he reported at 9 a.m. following his arrest and release on Saturday.

El-Rufai had a chat with the SSS Director General, Ita Ekpenyong, then returned home.

He was accompanied by his lawyer, A. Mustapha, and ThisDay publisher, Nduka Obaigbena.

He thanked Nigerians for their support and kind words over his arrest, based on an article he published, and said he would continue to play a robust role in promoting informed discourse and democracy.

In the meantime however, Boko Haram is unrelenting in its attacks, which now include robbery.

On Monday morning, those suspected to be the sect's members killed a policeman, a former Council Chairman, and two employees of Shani Council in Borno, and zoomed off with N21.5 million meant to pay the workers.

Two persons wounded with bullets are in hospital.

Police Public Relations Officer, Lawal Abdullahi, confirmed the killings and the robbery.

He said: ""Yes, I am aware of the incidents but you guys have to be patient with me for now because I am on my way to Abuja on an official assignment.""

Shani Council Caretaker Chairman, Modu Walama, explained that the gunmen lay in ambush between Marama and Bulatawiwi villages and opened fire on the council staff conveying the money.

""The armed robbers drove in a white Toyota starlet car, overtook them from nowhere and opened fire on six of them.

""They killed four, including a former council caretaker Chairman popularly called Ori, a police escort, and two other local government personnel.

""We have just returned from the burial of some of them. The two other ones who were lucky to escape death are now in hospital.""

In his reaction, former Ambassador George Obiozor warned that, ""the spate of insecurity in Nigeria is getting out of hand and I expect the government to take a firm decision on the Boko Haram menace.

""It must contain this sect because no country develops in a state of insecurity. It is the challenge of leadership and I hope (Jonathan) will rise up to this security challenge.""

Obiozor said the security agencies ought to be conscious of the smallest security detail.

""What is happening now poses great danger to the peace and development of this country and must be handled with great tact. Development will be stalled and investments will suffer if this dastardly act is not contained.""

Pahek Security Service Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Keku, advocated the use of force to flush out Boko Haram.

He blamed the council areas where the sect first operated for inability to pass information to the security agencies on their locations.

He insisted that the sect members live among the people and are not invincible.

Ketu noted that if the people are not willing to co-operate, it becomes more difficult to detect the criminals.

He said the functions of council Chairmen include grassroots development and gathering security information, and criticised the upper tiers of government for not involving councils in fighting crime.

Jere Council Chairman in Borno State, Mustapaha Ba'ale, was on Sunday shot dead in his home by Boko Haram members, after they had killed three others and wounded a former soldier on Saturday.

The sect murdered another eight persons and injured 13 at Wulari Mammy Market, Maiduguri.

Ba'ale, appointed Caretaker Committee Chairman by Governor Kashim Shettima two weeks ago, was attacked in Madinatu, in old Maiduguri at about 4 p.m.

He was a former state lawmaker, and had also contested the House of Representatives election on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP).

On Saturday, Boko Haram killed three persons and wounded a former soldier in Bulabuli-Ngaranaram, a suburb of Maiduguri.

The gunmen muffled their guns with pillows to block cracking sounds that would have attract the security operatives on patrol.

The attacks took place between 11 p.m. and midnight, during which three Boko Haram members scaled fences to kill non-Muslim residents.

Abba Panam, a mason, and two brothers; Sani Umar, 35, and Apagu Umar, 30; were killed.

The former soldier, identified simply as Joseph, escaped with several bullet wounds.

Panam's wife narrated that three men jumped into their compound at about 11 p.m., separated the women, and asked Panam to lie down.

""They asked if my husband would stop being a Christian and become one of them (Muslim) and my husband told them that no, I am already a Christian. Then they shot him in the head,"" she narrated.

A senior staff of the Toro Local Government Secretariat, who pleaded anonymity, said that the gunmen numbering about five, arrived the station at about 9pm and shot sporadically into the air to scare people away.

According to the eye witness, ""the sound of the gun caused pandemonium, not only among the policemen on duty, but also students of Government Secondary School, Toro, as well as members of the public who scampered away for safety.

""When the gunmen entered the police station, they met it empty, as all the policemen on duty had ran away for their dear lives, leaving behind their arms and other belongings,"" he disclosed.

The source further said that the gunmen ransacked the station, carting away guns and ammunition and freed the only suspect in the cell who was detained at the station for stealing a goat.

It was learnt that they left behind at the station a bag suspected to contain an explosive.

However, no casualty was recorded during the operation as the hoodlums carried out their attack unchallenged.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Bauchi State Police Command, Mohammed Barau, confirmed the incident and said no life was lost, adding that ""the police is yet to ascertain the number of arms and ammunition that the attackers went away with.""

He said the command has already drafted the anti-bomb disposal experts of the command to comb the area for possible hidden bomb.

The PPRO said investigation into the incident had begun, expressing optimism that the perpetrators of the act would soon be brought to book."

Minna — TWENTY- four hours after the blast that claimed four lives and injured others at All Christian Fellowship Mission Church, Suleja, another blast exploded, yesterday, at Ecwa Church in Madalla town, near Suleja.

Nigeria : Again, Bomb Blast Kills Three in Borno, Two Soldiers Injured

Chesa Chesa, Joe Nwankwo, Abdulkareem Haruna And Baba Negedu

Kaduna/Abuja/Maiduguri — Three Boko Haram members were on Tuesday killed in Maiduguri in a bomb blast which also injured two soldiers on Joint Task Force (JTF) patrol.

Residents of the city have continued to flee the onslaught from the Islamic sect, an exodus that increased on Monday after its threat to attack the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID).

Some have also alleged that soldiers maltreat them.

The Committee of Borno Elders and Leaders of Thought has called for the withdrawal of the JTF, accusing soldiers of killing hundreds of innocent youths, and causing others to flee.

Eyewitnesses said the bomb on Tuesday was thrown at a JTF patrol vehicle around Fannah Dori filling station on Baga Road at about 8 a.m.

Troops opened fire at the direction where the explosive came from, and supposedly killed three Boko Haram members.

But some alleged, however, that stray bullets killed five innocent persons, not three Boko Haram members.

National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) North East Information Officer, Ibrahim Farinloye, said two corpses were evacuated.

A statement issued by JTF Spokesman, Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, confirmed that the explosion on Baga Road targeted JTF patrol, and ""three of the attackers died in the blast and two soldiers were injured.""

Another statement signed by 18 members of the Elders' Committee, among them Shettima Ali Monguno and Abba Kyari, lamented the deteriorating insecurity in the state, and accused the JTF of rubbing salt in people's injury rather than restoring order.

""The presence of thousands of weapon-brandishing soldiers on the streets of Maiduguri has turned the situation into a nightmare, the worst Maiduguri has ever seen.

""Many hundreds of youths have been shot and killed by soldiers for no known reason other than that they are young. Many communities have been sacked and people in their thousands are fleeing Maiduguri,"" the Committee lamented.

It demanded the ""immediate withdrawal of all soldiers from the streets of Maiduguri, because they have been burning down houses, killing innocent people, looting private property, harassing innocent passersby and even burning down cars and raping young girls.""

It urged Boko Haram to pursue its demands by other means, and asked government agencies to stop making inflammatory remarks and dialogue with the sect members.

In reaction the JTF described the claims of the Committee as ""baseless and uncalled for at a moment when the state is facing a challenging security.""

It reassured the public ""that members of the JTF will never act in anyway against the peace of the state.""

Secretary to the State Government, Ahmed Jidda, called on the fleeing residents to return to their homes as their safety is guaranteed by the government and the JTF.

The Intra-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), which comprises political party Chairmen nationwide, also expressed concern over insecurity and urged Abuja to engage in dialogue with Boko Haram.

IPAC Chairman Osita Okereke told reporters after a meeting of the group that the Federal Government should dialogue with all aggrieved segments of the society, particularly Boko Haram and all other armed groups, and urged the security agencies to live up to their responsibility of intelligence gathering.

On Monday, another major tragedy was averted in Kaduna when security agents discovered two explosives just before the swearing in of 23 council Sole Administrators by Governor Patrick Yakowa.

The bombs were hidden behind a fence near the Umaru Musa Yar'Adua indoor sports complex on Independence Way, venue of the event.

Down in Abuja, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) on Tuesday decried insecurity in the North and pledged support for President Goodluck Jonathan as he faces the challenging task of governance.

A delegation of 19 ACF members, led by the Board of Trustees (BoT) Chairman, Jeremiah Useni, stated the position during a meeting with Jonathan at the Villa in Abuja.

The ACF said it shares the concern of Jonathan and the Federal Government on the insecurity in the North, and deplored the militancy and violations of the rule of law across the country.

Jos, Plateau State was on Sunday night rocked by two explosions at a popular bar, leading to an unknown number of deaths.

Jos — The serial killings in Plateau State continued unabated as 11 people were again murdered in cold blood in separate attacks on villages in Jos North and Jos South local government areas on Sunday night.

Seven people were killed and three injured at Zallaki village near Babale in Jos North Local Government Area while four people, including a 74-year-old man, his wife and two grandchildren were murdered in the same circumstance at Dabwak near Kuru in Jos South Local Government Area. Ten others were injured in nearby Farin Lamba in the local government.

The attackers suspected to be Fulani men and allegedly backed by some people in uniform stormed the two villages between 8 and 10pm shooting sporadically and hacking down those who tried to escape. Two buildings were torched during the attack on Zallaki.

Sunday's killings marked the fourth attack targeted at families in which a total of about 25 people have been killed.

The attack on Dabwak coming less than 24 hours after a similar one around Heipang where a family of eight were murdered, generated protests from youths in the area resulting in the burning of four trailers, two buses and two cars.

The youths in apparent protest against the alleged involvement of soldiers in the attack took to the highway stopping vehicles and manhandling some travelers, forcing some travelers to hurriedly turn back.

The youths demanded the withdrawal of members of the Special Task Force (STF) who they accused of compromising their duty of securing the people.

Tears and wailings welcomed the state Commissioner for Information, Mr. Yiljap Abraham, the Chairman of Jos North Local Government Area, Mr. Timothy Buba and others to Zallaki village as they inspected the scene of the attack which was littered by spent bullet shells.

An eye witness told the team that the attackers came in two Opel cars and were allegedly later joined by a military Hilux vehicle, adding that the attack lasted about two hours.

Buba who lamented what he called the inhuman behavior of the attackers alleged that the account of the villagers had shown that the attack was with the connivance of the military and supported calls for their withdrawal.

Yiljap was near tears as he bemoaned the series of attacks saying, ""Plateau is under siege from external aggressors."" He said government was working hard to unmask those behind the attacks and was optimistic that a breakthrough would be made soon in this regard.

He described calls for the declaration of a state of emergency in the state as ""uncalled for"" and urged those making the calls to join hands with others to address the security challenges which he said was not peculiar to Plateau State."

Jos — Two explosive devices thrown from a moving car last night blasted at the West of Mines area of Jos last night, wounding many people, according to witnesses.

The blasts happened at about 8: 30 pm and were targeted at shops, restaurants, drinking joints and other eateries in the area.

It could not be confirmed if there were deaths, but a witness said a man whose leg was severed had been taken to a hospital.

People run away from the place for fear of being hit by another explosion. The area was also cordoned off by police and military personnel shortly after.

A lady resident of West of Mines told our correspondent that she was sitting in her room a few meters away from the scene when she heard the first blast which sounded like the blasting of a rock.

She said not quite a minute after that, she heard another blast and immediately saw people running away from the area screaming that there was a bomb.

She said the people who were near the scene talked about seeing a device thrown from a moving vehicle which immediately exploded and that after the car gained some distance, the occupants threw another one which also exploded.

The sound of the second blast made people who were advancing towards the place to assist people hit by the first explosion to run away fearing there might be another blast.

Spokesman for the Special Task Force (STF), Cpt. Charles Ekeocha, confirmed there were blasts to our correspondent.

He said the task force sent its men to find out the details.

Ekeocha said he could not confirm the number of casualties as he was yet to get a report from his men who went to the scene.

The West of Mines area houses many restaurants and drinking joints and is usually very busy in the evenings as people throng there to relax or buy delicacies like roasted fish or chicken.

The incident has sent the whole Jos into panic as people made frantic calls to confirm if the incident was true and whether it could provoke another round of violence on the crises ridden town.

There were at least three similar explosions in Jos over the past one year, starting from the Christmas Eve bombing that left many dead.

Jos has seen a renewed cycle of internecine violence since end of last month, when Muslims saying their Eid el-Fitr prayers were reported to be attacked by Christian youths. Many people died on that day, sparking days of violence in the city.

The violence moved to the adjoining villages, with late-night gun raids nearly every day, in some cases wiping out entire families.

Nearly 100 people have been killed in the latest cycle of violence, according to news reports.

From TIMOTHY OLA, Maiduguri

Monday, October 17, 2011

A police corporal, Malam Maliki who recently wedded and the leader of Borno State Vigilante Association (BOVA), Ali Banga were at the weekend shot dead in Maiduguri by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram.



Sources said Banga, 45 had been on the wanted list of the gunmen having trailed him to his house on different occasions without success until last Saturday at about 7.40pm when they finally shot him dead at his Mairi residence within the metropolis barely 24 hours after the killing of Maliki, the police corporal.

Corporal Maliki until his death last weekend was an intelligence cop. He was reportedly killed around the Gomari Airport area while coming from a pharmaceutical shop where he had gone to buy drugs for his new wife, who he married few months ago. Some of the residents of the area claimed the wife was having malaria.



Sources said the gunmen who came in a Golf car had parked near Maliki’s house and opened fire on him as soon as they sighted him, a development which led to residents in the area to scamper for safety. “It was later we saw his body on the ground in a pool of blood,” one of the residents who preferred anonymity “for security reason” disclosed in a chat with Daily Sun.



Borno State Commissioner of Police, Simeon Midenda who confirmed the two incidents said the body of the police corporal had been deposited at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital mortuary, adding that the police had swung into action to investigate the matter while equally strengthening their surveillance on the city.

Midenda appealed to residents not to panic, adding that the police and other security agencies in the state were doing everything possible to ensure normalcy fully returned to the state.



Daily Sun observed that the renewed attacks on the state by the members of the Islamic sect was creating fears among the people. Many have resorted into prayers, noting that only divine intervention could truly bring the desired peace into the state."

Nigeria : Bomb Blast Destroys Block Industry in Maiduguri

A bomb blast, which occurred in the early hours of Sunday, in Jajere area of Maiduguri metropolis, destroyed a local block industry.

An eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that the bomb was planted on the road from where it later exploded to hit the block industry.

He, however, said nobody was killed or injured in the blast as it was very early in the morning and many residents were still indoors.

The Operation Commander of the Joint Task Force (JTF) in Borno State, Col. Victor Ebhaleme confirmed the incident (bomb blast), adding that security had been beefed up in the area.

'The bomb was planted on the road and no life was lost or casualty recorded in the explosion. It was only a local block industry in the area that was affected,' he said.

He, however, reminded residents that the deadline for the submission of arms remained till Monday.

Ebhaleme disclosed that some people had complied with the directive, saying this led to the recovery of a large number of weapons by the JTF.

The commander, however, warned that those who failed to submit dangerous weapons in their possession at the expiration of the deadline would be treated as criminals.

Nigeria : Kaduna Boils, As Gunmen Kill Women in Church

Garba Muhammad

Kaduna — KADUNA State is under tension over fears of reprisal attack, following the murder of two Christian women worshippers inside a church by unknown gunmen.

The attack by the gunmen also left 11 critically injured in Zonkwa village in Zangon Kataf Local Government in the state. The women were said to have gone for vigil.

The Moment learnt that the injured have since been taken to Saint Louis Hospital in Zonkwa, while the deceased were taken to the mortuary.

The Interim Caretaker Chairman of Zangon Kattaf LG, Dominic Yahaya, confirmed the attack in a text message to The Moment.

He said: 'An attack took place at Tabak near Zonkwa on the way to Madakiya at 11:45pm.

People mostly, women and children were attacked inside a church while holding night vigil prayers.

'Thirteen people were shot and two women died, while 11 others have been admitted at Saint Louis hospital, Zonkwa, the attackers escaped into the bush.'

However, the situation has set youths in the area on rampage. They were said to have started burning tyres and barricading roads to protest the incessant incidents in the full glare of the security men whom they accused of perpetrating the attacks in the area.

Some of the youths appealed for the overhaul of the security operations of the area, where they said ""the soldiers posted to provide security have become nuisance to the area.

'We strongly suspecting them to be responsible for the attack just to create tension in the state and continue to justify their stay in the area.'

The Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Ballah Magaji Nassarawa, who also confirmed the incident on phone, said he was on his way to the scene of the incidence, together with the Kaduna State Governor, Patrick Ibrahim Yakowa, to assess the situation.

He, however, said report reaching him from the security men on ground indicated that the situation has been brought under control.

In a swift reaction, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) condemned the incident just as it expressed worry over the continued spate of attack, especially on churches in spite of the heavy security presence in the state.

In a statement signed by the Kaduna State Secretary, Yunusa Madu, and made available to The Moment, the Christian body said: 'CAN Kaduna State condemns the manner the last night's attack was carried out on innocent Christian worshipers in the church.

'Indeed, the troubles of Kaduna have taken their senseless killings to the doorsteps of God and this is very dangerous for us as a state.

'We are worried that in spite of the heavy presence of soldiers in the area, this kind of attack can still be carried out.

'Information reaching me from the Local CAN in Zonkwa confirmed that sophisticated raffles were used.

'We call on the government of Kaduna State to ensure that the perpetrators of this evil act are fished out and brought to book. Meanwhile, we call on all Christians to be calm and prayerful in the face of this new dimension of attack on the church, 'CAN affirmed.

The National Secretary of the Jama'atu Nasril, JNI, Dr. Khalid Abubakar, did not respond to text message sent to him.

When our correspondent called his number after one hour, the GSM phone was switched off.

The state Chairman of JNI, Ja'afaru Makarfi could not be reached for comment, as his GSM number was switched off.

Four policemen were killed, while the said police outpost as well as the rescue unit of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) was completely ravaged.

Witnesses said the incident occurred at about 10pm when gunmen numbering about 20 invaded the area and started firing at the police station and throwing several explosives into the building, which razed it down.

Investigations further revealed that the residents had gone to bed but were suddenly woken up by the endless sounds of heavy gunfire, heard throughout the town.

""We started hearing gunshots all of a sudden and then the bomb explosion at the police station. Everybody was confused and started running helter-skelter as they started shooting in the air in the town,"" Bunu added.

He reiterated that the gunmen burnt down the police station and set all the inmates free. They also took away large quantities of arms and ammunition.

Another witness who spoke on condition of anonymity explained that, after destroying the police outpost, the gunmen proceeded to the nearby FRSC rescue unit, fired several shots before detonating heavy explosives.

The police commissioner, Borno State command, Mr. Simoen Midenda, confirmed that there were attacks by gunmen but denied some policemen were killed.

Yenagoa- Four persons were killed while several others sustained gunshot injuries Wednesday night in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, in renewed violence reportedly unleashed by suspected cultists.

The violent attack, which occurred in the densely populated Ekeki suburb of Yenagoa at 7pm, caused pandemonium as residents scampered for safety. Reasons for the attack could not be ascertained.

It was gathered that some youths suspected to be cultists, armed with the deadly AK-47 rifles, in mafia-styled operation, drove into the Ekeki suburb, host to the major motor park in the state capital, and started shooting sporadically.

Two persons were reportedly killed on the spot while two others sustained serious injuries and later gave up the ghost at Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa, where they were taken for treatment.

The sound of gunshots that shattered the night forced most of the relaxation spots and retail outlets within the vicinity of the attack to hurriedly shutdown.

Motorists approa-ching the Ekeki suburb of Yenagoa on Chief Melford Okilo Road, were forced to turn back and drive against traffic. Others abandoned their vehicles and took to their heels for fear of being caught in the cross fire.

The timely interven-tion of men of the Joint Task Force for the Niger Delta, codenamed Operation Restore Hope and the police preven-ted the situation from deteriorating further.

Three suspects were reportedly arrested by the security operatives.

Police: 2 wounded in bomb blast in north Nigeria

(AP) LAGOS, Nigeria — Authorities say two people were wounded after a bomb exploded in a city in northern Nigeria.



Bauchi state police spokesman Mohammed Barau said Saturday that the explosion happened around 7 p.m. Friday in the state capital of Bauchi. Barau said explosive experts visited the scene of the blast inside the city and have begun an investigation.



Barau said police continued to investigate the blast, but had no idea of the motive behind the attack.



The attack comes after more than 100 people died in bombings and gunfights carried out Nov. 4 in northeast Nigeria. A radical Muslim sect known as Boko Haram claimed responsibility.



Boko Haram has been carrying out a string of targeted assassinations for more than a year by gunmen on motorcycles and carrying out bombings in the north.

THREE suspected Boko Haram gunmen have killed an 18-year-old Islamic student (name withheld) in Borno State.

Confirming the killing yesterday, spokesman of Joint Task Force (JTF), Lt. Col Hassan Mohammed said: “We received the reports of the attacks and killing of an Islamic student at the Railway Quarters on Sunday, where three suspected Boko Haram gunmen attacked the residence of an Islamic scholar; and shot dead one of his students.”

He said that the slain student was alleged to be an informant to the police and other security agents in Borno State.

Mohammed said no arrest had been made by either the JTF or police, as the suspects fled to the neighbouring wards of Kumshe and Abaganaram, South of the sect’s destroyed enclave.

“The gunmen came in an unmarked vehicle at about 7.30 p.m. on Saturday and one of them pulled out a Kalashnikov rifle and shot at

the Islamic student in the head , before we were alerted to the attacks and killing at the residence of Islamic teacher at 9 p.m.”

Mohammed said the body of the slain student had been deposited at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) for “autopsy and identification” by the families of the killed Islamic student.

Speaking on the quick responses of JTF on serial attacks and killings in Maiduguri by the suspected armed sect members, he said: “The JTF field operation officer, Col. Victor Ebhaleme has released three telephone numbers-07085464012, 08154429346, 08064174066- to members of the general public to pass information to the task force on the modus operandi and hideouts of sect members.”

He assured that such information

would be treated with the utmost confidentiality and be exposed to the armed sect and bombers.

Meanwhile, traditional rulers in Kaduna State have been asked to live up to their responsibility in ensuring that they control the activities of their subjects for peace to prevail in various parts of the state.

The Commissioner for Information and Home Affairs in the state, Alhaji Saidu Adamu said that the recent outbreak of violence in Kafanchan and other parts of Southern Kaduna indicated that the rulers were not in control of affairs in their domains.

He warned the rulers to ensure that they were in full control of affairs in their communities as government would frown on a situation whereby the traditional rulers refused to play their roles in partnering the state government to control the activities of their subjects, particularly those bent on fomenting trouble.

Adamu who spoke with The Guardian on efforts made by government to ensure that peace returned to Zango Kataf and Jema’a Local Government areas where there were upheavals last week, said that it was unfortunate that the traditional rulers in the areas could not have firm control of affairs of their subjects and allowed the situation to degenerate.

By Michael Olugbode

Borno State Governor, Alhaji Kashim Shettima, was welcomed back to the state from Abuja where he won the legal battle against his election by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with a bomb explosion believed to be aimed at putting the shine off his celebration.

The explosive device which was suspected to be by Boko Haram went off in Maiduguri, Borno State capital about the time the governor’s motorcade was expected to arive the area. The state police Commissioner, Simeon Midenda, said the blast came from a canister thrown at a police patrol vehicle “but did not affect neither the targeted vehicle nor any person around.”

Midenda, who spoke on phone to journalists said “we have taken serious security measure that led to frustrating the attempted attack at our vehicle and we can assure all members of the state that we are on top of the situation.”

ThisDay gathered that barely 40 minutes after the Governor’s motorcade had begun to inch towards the city from the Maiduguri International Airport where he arrived the state from Abuja at about 3.30pm, an explosion was heard at about 1km ahead of the governor’s convoy which sent residents that had filed out to cheer him to scamper for safety.

it is believed that the heavy presence of security along the route that the governor was to pass might have frustrated the plan of the bombers to hit at the governor and they instead decided to throw the bomb at one of the patrol vehicles stationed on the road.

The governor who arrived moment later, did not let the bomb incident take the shine off his celebration as he waved to the crowds who had to come out on hearing the siren from his motorcade.

Shettima later told newsmen shortly after arriving government house Maiduguri that his government will continue to toe the path of peace and negotiation, and called on those in opposition to take the path of honour by withdrawing their swords of political hostility and join him in running the state.

He said though the victory was a thing of joy to him and his party, but he said “honestly we do not even enjoy the luxury of a protracted legal tussle in Borno taking into cognizance the developmental challenges and the insurgency facing us in the state.”

“So I wish to once again implore on members of the opposition to shelve their swords and come and join hands with us for the greater glory of Borno”.

Governor Shettima called on the people of the state to join him in administering the state most especially as the petition induced-distraction was over, adding that he does not claim the monopoly of knowledge and with all sense of humility he is calling on all and sundry to join hands with his government as “Borno is for all of us and it is our duty to see that we catapult the state to the highest level of development; for our people have suffered more than enough and it now beholves on all of us to ensure that their sufferings are alleviated.”"

Daily Trust correspondent, who witnessed the incident, reports that the clash ensued as a result of the arrest of customers of the sex hawkers by the police. The policemen arrived the hotel in a 14-seater commercial bus with number plate Lagos XZ 561 LND. And on arrival, four of them went into the hotel, leaving one officer and the driver of the bus behind. After a while, those who went in were heard exchanging words with the prostitutes, who protested the arrest of their clients.



Our correspondent reports that despite the protest, the policemen forcefully dragged five persons from the hotel into the bus. But when the sixth person was brought out, he asked the police what his offence was, and none of them answered him. At that point, the prostitutes started shouting ole, ole, ole (thief, thief, thief) at the policemen.



The prostitutes were however forced to shut up when one of the policemen threatened to shoot them if they continued with the insult. After the prostitutes calmed down, the policemen went into their bus and sped off the scene with the six arrested persons.



Attempt to get comments from any of the policemen was fruitless as none of them was ready to speak to anyone. But one of the prostitutes, who simply identified herself as Rose, alleged that policemen always come to the hotel to harass them and their customers.



“They will tell us that they have been asked to come and ‘raid’ us by their boss. And if we ask what our offence is, they won’t tell us. Sometimes, some of them will even force us to sleep with them before we can be released,” Rita said.



When contacted for comments on the issue, the spokesperson of the Lagos Police Command, DSP Samuel Jinadu said the matter would be investigated...

Reports said the incident happened during a communal clash over who was the rightful person to assume the traditional stool of the village.

But, National Mirror gathered that the battle for the traditional stool has been on for years culminating in the recent communal clash. Chief Onyekwe, 65, was allegedly killed along with his wife and six other family members during the crisis. Informed sources told National Mirror that the deceased traditional ruler, who was the Onu-Omabo, a third class traditional ruler, had been having a running battle with his kinsmen since he was appointed as the ruler of the village by the state government.

This development allegedly made him to be operating from Idah, a nearby town from where he was conducting the affairs of the community. National Mirror sources further said that the people of the community were not happy with his emergence as they believed that the appointment did not follow the normal process. They alleged that Chief Onyekwe was imposed on them by some powerful indigenes of the village that are holding high profile political offices in the administration of Governor Ibrahim Idris.

It was equally gathered that the crisis reached its climax on Sallah day, when the traditional ruler, in company of his wife and other family members decided to travel to the village to celebrate the Sallah festival. Getting to the village, sources said the villagers decided to organise a protest match against his return which they claimed will not augur well for the community. It was further revealed that the protest turned violent when one of the relations of the traditional ruler believed to be his junior brother was alleged to have shot at the protesters with a locally made short gun which led to the death of a young man.

This development led to a free-for-all-fight between the supporters of the traditional ruler and his kinsmen; in the ensuing commotion, some unknown persons killed the traditional ruler, his wife and six other members of his family. Reports said some members of the village have been arrested by men of the Kogi State Police Command as at time of filing this report. When contacted, the state’s Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), Mr. Okasanmi Ajayi, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) confirmed the report and said the situation has been brought under control, stressing that investigation was on-going to fish out those responsible for the dastardly act. He said a sizeable number of people from the village have been arrested in connection with the incident, but that further investigation will determine their levels of involvement."

Yola — The Adamawa State Police Command on Thursday, confirmed the death of one person while three others were injured in an armed robbery attack in Jimeta, Yola.

The spokeswoman of the command, ASP. Altine Daniel, in Yola said that the incident occurred at about 2 p.m. when gunmen suspected to be armed robbers attacked Luka Memorial Store at the Low Cost Housing Estate in Jimeta.

Narrating his ordeal on his sick bed at the Federal Medical Centre where he had been receiving treatment, the manager of the Store, Mr Joseph Tumba, said he was in his office discussing with his brother when two gunmen marched in and demanded for the key of his safe.

""I gave them my car keys to check for the safe keys but when they checked and didn't find it, the gang leader furiously cocked his gun to shoot me and a scuffle ensued between us.

"" I quickly jumped and held the gunman we both felt to the ground, not knowing to me that a third gunman stood outside and swiftly rushed in and started shorting at everyone in sight, killing one and injuring three including myself,"" Tumba said

He, however, recalled that few months back, he had received text messages from an unknown number threatening to kill him.

""So when they came in and said 'where is the money?' It reminded me of the threats, though one cannot be too sure.

"" I plead with the government and security agencies to beef up security in the state to forestall future occurrence,"" he pleaded. (NAN)

More Stories on This Section Serial killing continued in Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro local government areas of Bauchi State as four people were killed yesterday while five others were injured following overnight attack in Gangare village, Bogoro Local Government Area.



Last Thursday, two youths in the area, Bukata Bitrus and Masoyi Bitrus, were gruesomely murdered near Dalmundin village in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area.

Secretary of the Sayawa Traditional Rulers and Council of Elders, Barrister Bukata Zhadi, lamented the recent killings in Bogoro, saying it has brought the number of those killed in the community to 12 in three months.

Confirming the incident, Police Commissioner,



Mr. Ikechukwu Ayo Aduba said, “We received the report, but I don’t have the details yet, we are trying to get the report from the Divisional Police Officer.

“You know the problem in the area before now, but we have restored peace there except these little, little things, but we want to encourage them to form vigilante group in the communities so that whenever they notice such things they can inform us and we can act immediately ”



In his account, Barrister Bukata Zhadi said, “The people came to the village in the night, killed four people and injured five.“We have reported the matter to the police and soldiers have been deployed in the area to restore peace.”

According to Zhadi, “we feel really bad about these killings. The community is not out to retaliate or do anything, but we want the government to investigate the guerrilla attacks on Sayawa in Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local government areas.



“The killing of these four has brought the number to 12 in three months. The victims, who are Sayawa, are always ambushed and killed, some in their houses and some on raids. The security operatives must investigate these attacks,” Zhadi said. Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro have become flashpoints due to attacks and counter attacks between the Hausa/Fulani and Sayawa communities, which claimed hundreds of lives and property worth millions of naira.

Experts believe the problem, which is rooted in politics, usually takes religious dimension where the Christian Sayawa and Muslim Hausa/Fulani take up arms against each other in violent clashes.



Governor Isa Yuguda recently signed a law by the House of Assembly, which created the Sayawa Chiefdom, which had been agitated for decades in a bid to bring lasting peace.



But citing the headquarters temporarily at Bogoro and subsequently moving it permanently to Marti Giji and not Tafawa Balewa as demanded by the Sayawa has further made peace elusive. Dissatisfied with the proposed headquarter, the Sayawa community sued the government, insisting they would not accept anything short of Tafawa Balewa as headquarters of the new Sayawa Chiefdom, adding that Tafawa Balewa was the ancestral home of the Sayawa people.

The death toll in clashes between two feuding ethnic groups in the Barkin Ladi area of Jos,the Plateau State capital, has risen to 25, a local official said yesterday, following a mass burial that included four of his own children. A councillor in Barkin Ladi local government council, Mr. Pam Choji, who lost four children in Wednesday's attack, said that 23 of the victims were interred on Friday.



He said the corpses of two other people who were shot dead in the clashes were expected to be buried yesterday, ""which will make 25 people that we would have buried.""



A Plateau State government spokesman, Ayuba Pam, had said on Thursday that at least 12 people were killed in the clashes between ethnic Fulani, mainly Muslims, and Beroms, who are predominantly Christians.



Newspapers yesterday, quoting an army spokesman, said that more that 160 people had been arrested over the clashes, which appeared to result from reprisals carried out over killings that had occurred several days ago.



The area has been caught in a deadly cycle of attacks and reprisals that have regularly flared up for years.

Beroms and other mainly Christian ethnic groups are viewed as indigenous in the area, while Hausa-Fulani Muslims are seen as the more recent ""settlers"" despite the fact that many have been there for decades.



Separately in the countryside, clashes over land have occurred between Berom farmers and Fulani herdsmen.

Thousands have been killed in the unrest in recent years. Dozens died in violence including bomb blasts on Christmas Eve 2010 and the days that followed."

Maiduguri — Tragedy was averted yesterday when a detachment of the Joint Task Force (JTF) operatives escaped death narrowly, after a bomb planted by suspected Boko Haram sects members detonated on top of a tree under which they were said to be sitting.

The bomb was said to have exploded around 8:00 pm close to a unit of the JTF at the London Ciki area of the Maiduguri metropolis. It was gathered that the blast which, triggered chaos among residents of the area was immediately trailed by intermittent gunshots which continued through the night.

""From all indications the assailants took a careful survey of the area and decided to hang the explosive device on the tree because of its proximity to the station of the JTF in the area. It was really a bizarre situation because we have never seen something like that"", a resident who declined to be identified told Daily Trust.

Reacting to the incident, the Spokesman of the JTF Lt. Col Hassan Mohammed said that there was no casualty in the attacks and assured residents of the JTF's commitment to protect lives and property in Borno state.

Ahmed Mohammed

Bauchi — More than 100 gunmen suspected to be from the Boko Haram sect raided Azare, Bauchi State, early yesterday morning, bombing two police stations and two banks in an attack that killed many people, residents and police authorities said.

A solider, a policeman and many other people were killed in the attack in Azare, headquarters of Katagum Local Government Area, about 218 kilometres north of the Bauchi state capital, residents told Daily Trust.

The attackers, who launched their assault shortly after midnight, bombed the police area command and a nearby police station, reducing them to rubble. They also bombed and robbed local branches for the Guaranty Trust Bank and Intercontinental Bank, residents said.

Bauchi State Police commissioner Ikechukwu Aduba confirmed the incident, saying a police officer, a soldier, a civilian and three gunmen were killed during the attack that lasted for hours.

""Our men did their best; they prevented the attackers from gaining entrance into the barracks. Every side suffered casualty, we suffered our casualty, our mobile policeman was killed, a soldier was killed, and a civilian, and the hoodlums also suffered many casualties,"" he told Daily Trust. ""It's a real war because the hoodlums invaded Azare in large numbers. They are over 100. We did our best but because of the power of fire arms both sides suffered casualties.""

The commissioner said over 20 rocket-propelled bombs were launched from outside the area command's headquarters building, leaving the structure completely destroyed. He said about 30 policemen on duty at the area command office responded and repelled the attackers.

""The attack was launched simultaneously at six facilities including the mobile police base, the area commander's office, the police station, two banks and one Ali Kwara's residence,"" he said. Ali Kwara is a popular local thief catcher, who also served as security adviser to a minister of the FCT in 2007-2008.

The Associated Press news agency quoted Aduba as saying no arrest was made, but that the Boko Haram sect was suspected of carrying out the attack.

A senior official of Katagum LGA said when they launched their attack, the gunmen blocked all the roads leading to the places they intended to target. ""Then we heard sporadic gunshots and huge blasts. The attack lasted for over three hours,"" he said.

A Red Cross official, who was at the Federal Medical Centre in Azare where victims of the attacks were taken, said he saw the bodies of a soldier, a policeman and an errand boy for the police, while two policemen were being treated for gunshot wounds.

Even though the police commissioner confirmed the death of six people including the gunmen, residents told Daily Trust that the number of those killed in the attack was much more than the police were admitting.

A resident who does not want to be named said apart from policemen who were killed in the shootout with the gunmen, there were also detainees in police cells who were killed as the bombs exploded. He said also that there were newly transferred police personnel staying in the premises of the area command and some of them might have been killed in the attack.

When asked by Daily Trust if the police were understating the deaths, police commissioner Aduba said, ""We are not hiding anything. Outside the fence of our office we saw blood, a lot of blood was lost, which clearly shows that they (the gunmen) too have suffered casualties and from the report three of the hoodlums were gunned down.

""Go and ask anybody in Azare, this is the correct number of casualties we recorded. We don't have anything to hide; we too have relatives if people are affected they have relatives, the relatives will complain.""

Yesterday, there was heavy presence of riot policemen cordoning the roads leading to the areas attacked as police bomb squad sweep through the rubble of the razed structures. There were unexploded bomb canisters littering the premises of the two banks.

This was one of many similar attacks in Bauchi State in recent months. There had been such gun assaults and bomb raids in Misau, Gamawa, Alkaleri and Toro, some of which were claimed by the Boko Haram sect.

The gunmen, according to investigation, were targeting an SSS operative who normally visits the shop to interact with his friends after office hours. However, the Gwange explosion, which took place at Layin Bus Stop around 7.45 pm was believed to have been planted by the members of the sect that has been terrorising the northern part of the country, particularly Borno State.

National Mirror gathered that the gunmen, who laid siege on Polo area came with an unmarked Volkswagen Golf car at about 7.49 pm, when they opened fire on some people who were playing cards in front of a shop belonging to a GSM recharge card dealer, which led to the killing of two people, including the Head Teacher of COCIN Church Primary School in Polo, Mallam Caleb. But, an eye witness who does not want his name mentioned said, he was just passing along the road when he saw some gunmen opened fire from his direction, where he quickly laid down flat to avoid being hit by a stray bullet. He said, I just heard them saying to people, dont run, dont worry, we are not here for you, we have our target, I believe they came to hunt for one SSS man who normally comes here to play cards with some of his friends.

But, they ended up killing innocent people, one of whom they thought was the SSS man, but I learnt that he didnt visit the shop that day , he said. Polo was one area many people thought was a safety zone, as most of the residents are predominantly Christians, but it has now turned to a dangerous zone, as it has experienced several attacks in the past two months, unfortunately, the security agencies has failed to fish out the perpetrators.

Confirming the incident in a telephone conversation, spokesman of the Joint Task Force, JTF, Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed said, some members of the Boko Haram detonated an Improvised Explosive Device, IED, at about 7:45 pm on Wednesday in Gwange ward. He said the sect s members were targeting at one of their patrol vehicles, but they missed their target, as the planted bomb exploded after their patrol vehicle had left the area. No casualty was recorded in the blast. Similarly, Hassan said gunmen came to Polo with a Volkswagen Golf car at the same time when the Gwange Blast occurred and opened fire on som e members of the public. He said, the sound of the gunshots attracted his men who are based in the area where they quickly rushed to the scene."

Confirming the incident to newsmen the 303 Flying School Commander, Air Commodore Sani Ahmad, said some suspected gunmen struck at the school on Thursday night opening fire on his men and carted away many valuables.

He said when they attacked the base at about 7.30 to 8pm, his men quickly responded and a gun battle that lasted for about one hour ensued which resulted in the death of the two military officers instantly while one out of the two that were injured died at Mallam Aminu Kano Hospital after sustaining bullet wound.

Ahmad who refused to categorically state that the men were Boko Haram members, added that the only thing he know is that anybody who carried arm is a criminal whether he is Boko Haram or whatever, promising that they will soon get to the root of the incident.

He said that all the 110 children studying in the school were hale and hearty and that they tried to give them some sense of relief by being close to them, adding that they are studying the whole scenario and may deploy additional security personnel to the place.

'We are going to visualize the whole level of the security threat, analyse it and see whether we will send additional security attachment or not but for now we are keeping high vigil in the place and to us this people are armed robbers because after carting away some properties they also vandalized some houses nearby the school,' he said.

The suspected members of the Boko Haram who struck at the Military Comprehensive school were reported to have opened fire sporadically from the gate of the school for about half hour while unconfirmed report said that the military officers responded with heavy fire.

Our reporter who arrived the scene of the Friday morning hours saw some expended bullets at the gate of the school while the window glass the office of the security office at the school was shattered.

Also some heavy armed military personnel were seen guarding the school while every visitor to the school was made to pass through security scrutiny before being allowed into the school.

Luka Binniyat

Kaduna — A week after an explosion killed seven people leaving six injured in Kaduna, the city witnessed another bomb explosion yesterday triggering a pandemonium that sent hundreds of residents scampering to the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) Barracks about two kilometres away.

The explosion which occurred around 1:30pm on Ibrahim Rintiyi street, Unguwan Magaji, Kawo, Kaduna, demolished about seven buildings around the house where it exploded.

Though no death was recorded, three persons believed to be the occupants of the House, ran out of the building covered in blood, but were chased and apprehended by locals who promptly handed them over to the Police.

When Vanguard visited the site, around 3pm yesterday the place was smelling of gunpowder, with smoke still bellowing from house A R 33 where the explosion took place.

A crowd of soldiers, Police anti-bomb squad, Civil Defence Corps and plainclothesmen combed the ruins of the house where they discovered that it may have been an illegal armoury of sort, as three military rifles partly charred were recovered.

As at the time of going to Press, the Police said that there may be more arms buried underneath the ruins.

The Police anti-bomb squad came up with a sack full of what is believed to be bomb making devices, complete with a car battery and a generating set.

Mallam Muba Namando (60) who lives a few meters from House AR 33 spoke to Vanguard on his experience: ""It must have been around 1pm. I had just finished my afternoon prayers and about to come home, when the ground shook, and I heard this explosion.

Then I saw that house smoking. I thought it was gas cylinder that exploded. As I ran there, I saw three people running out. Then some people chased them and caught them. There was an argument about what to do with them. They were bleeding and two of them had burns on them. We then agreed that they cannot be taken to the Hospital without Police knowing.

""As we were looking for ways to get to the police, a series of more explosions took place. But no one was hurt, because we were already all out. By now the Police arrived and took them away,

""I have been here for about a year. This is the first time I am seeing this kind of thing""

According to Mallam Maidala Ilu (35) who also owns an uncompleted mud-house near the place of explosion, confirmed what Namando said. ""One of them was badly hurt and he was behaving as if he was mentally unstable. He was reciting the Quran and talking to himself. He made an attempt to escape. But was caught him and pinned him down. I later left for my shop about two kilometre away. Then I heard series of explosions from there"", he said.

The Ward Head of Unguwan Magaji Malam Mai Unguwan Yakubu in his own account said: ""This is the first time we saw this kind of explosive, except the one in mahuta just near by, but now we thank God since the law enforcement agents are all here so by God grace everything will be alright. ""I don't know the person that was renting the house now because they are new in this area"", he said

The owner of the property, Aminu Yusuf (42) was brought to the place under arrest.

He told journalists the he rented the house out through an agent on the 17th of July this year.

""I only know that they are Hausa people. I was told they were married with children, but that their families would join them later. Only the agent knows about them. I saw them once. The agent is an Hausa man called Abulrazak. That is all I know about him"", he said.

Damaturu — Multiple explosions and gunfire rocked Maiduguri, Damaturu and Potiskum yesterday, leaving unconfirmed number of people dead in cities that have witnessed deadly Boko Haram attacks in the recent past.

At least 5 explosions were heard in Maiduguri while no less than ten blasts and sporadic gun fire were reported in Damaturu, Yobe State.

In the two cities, combined forces of the military and police reportedly had fierce shootouts with members of the Boko Haram sect.

Residents and security sources fear that many people might have been killed or injured in the violence.

In Damaturu, the explosions were heard at an outskirts settlement Pompomari, behind the Federal Polytechnic, Damaturu.

The blasts in Maiduguri rocked Baga Road, Dala, Jajeri and Abbaganaram areas.

A senior official at the Sani Abacha Specialists Hospital in Damaturu confirmed that the body of a soldier was deposited at the mortuary.

""At our accident and emergency unit, as I am talking to you, we are treating about 7 policemen who sustained various degrees of injuries...I think many more are being brought,"" the official told Daily Trust at about 7pm.

""We also have a 10-year-old boy in the operation theatre. Doctors are trying to remove some bullets from his body,"" he said.

Witnesses said the encounter in Damaturu which started around 3pm yesterday lasted for more than 4 hours, as sounds of explosions and gunfire rent the air and thick smoke billow into the sky.

Pompomari resident Habiba Musa told our correspondent that she saw a group of armed men in plain clothes chanting ""Allahu Akbar"" (Allah is Great) as they walked past her thatch-roofed brick house.

""Shortly after they passed, I heard thunderous sounds of blasts. Few minutes later, I heard another one, then another one. I was rattled...in fact all of us in the neighborhood started wailing and crying but the sound of the gunshots continued unabated,"" she said.

Mohammed, a resident of Sabon Fegi, told our correspondent by telephone that sound of gunshots could still be heard in various parts of Damaturu metropolis around 8 o'clock last night.

He said he saw a Hilux vehicle belonging to the army on fire.

Yobe State police commissioner of Police, Lawan Tanko, who confirmed the blasts in Damaturu, said his men had ""really engaged"" the attackers for a very long time.

The commissioner, who briefly spoke on the phone said, ""We seriously engaged the Boko Haram assailants, and ultimately overpowered them. Most of them fled through the bush path of Gashua road.""Tanko said they were yet to ascertain the number of casualties.

But he confirmed that many houses and at least one place of worship were burnt at Pompomari area.

In Maiduguri, the first bomb went off around 5.58pm close to the Timber Market, along Baga road, and the devastating impact of the explosion shattered many buildings, including the glasses of a mosque and a store in the Media Trust regional office.

A resident of Dala, a suburb of Maiduguri, said a church was attacked in the area. ""I am right now inside my house which is not more than 300 metres away from the church. There are gunshots renting the air,"" he said.

Military sources in Maiduguri confirmed that members of the Boko Haram had attempted attacking JTF operatives in at least 6 places within a span of one hour.

Spokesman of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Ibrahim Farinloye said there may be casualties as a result of the simultaneous bombings. ""But the truth is that we have to liaise with various agencies to get the fact of the situation,"" Farinloye said.

In Potiskum, resident Idris Driver told our correspondent by telephone that some gunmen had laid siege in the town, which is located 120 kilometers south of Damaturu.

""I heard a loud blast and I am sure it is a bomb. If you can listen carefully, you can also hear the sound of gunshots through the phone,"" Idris said.

The three cities under attack last night had witnessed similar violence blamed on the Boko Haram sect. On Monday, a blast rocked a bomb factory in Damaturu, killing a suspected member of the Boko Haram and injuring 2 others.

Earlier on Saturday, a similar incident took place at Shuwari area of Maiduguri where three people were killed.

Fighting between the radical Islamist sect Boko Haram and paramilitary forces in northeast Nigeria has killed at least 61 people over several days of violence that has left churches bombed and people hiding in fear, authorities said.

In hard-hit Yobe state, where at least 50 people died, the government on Saturday ordered a dusk-till-dawn curfew following attacks by Boko Haram. In Maiduguri, the capital of neighbouring Borno state, bombs reduced at least three churches to rubble and raised fears of further attacks by a group that claimed Christmas Eve bombings last year that killed dozens.

The fighting began Thursday in the two states, with gunfire and explosions heard into the night and the following day in an arid region that borders Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Damaturu, the capital of Yobe state, and the town of Potiskum bore the brunt of the violence.

Kill-and-go

In Damaturu, residents fled their homes near the city's central mosque ahead of a combined attack by soldiers and the federal police's feared Mobile Police, known as 'kill-and-go' for their propensity for violence. The paramilitary forces raided the area in armoured personnel carriers and tanks, with heavy gunfire marking their arrival.

""We were able to kill 12 of the Boko Haram armed sect and bombers,"" local police commissioner Lawan Tanko said. The police commissioner said officers also recovered Kalashnikov rifles, ammunition and explosives.

In Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, a mortuary official who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter told reporters at least 11 bodies had been brought in from the violence. Authorities blamed Boko Haram for firebombing at least three churches around the capital, attacks that killed one pastor and his young child.

Contact with other terror groups

This is just the latest in a series of bombings over the last year by Boko Haram. The group wants to implement strict shariah law across a nation of more than 160 million people that is home to both Christians and Muslims.

Boko Haram has splintered into three factions, with one wing increasingly willing to kill as it maintains contact with terror groups in North Africa and Somalia, diplomats and security sources say.

That, as well as its increasingly violent attacks, have some worried the group will carry out further attacks around Christmas and New Year's.

Last year, a series of Christmas Eve bombings in the central Nigerian city of Jos claimed by Boko Haram killed at least 32 people and wounded at least 74 others.

Nigeria on Monday probed a wave of Christmas Day bomb attacks that killed at least 40 and was blamed on Islamists, including one blast that ripped through a crowd of worshippers exiting mass.

The government blamed Islamist sect Boko Haram for three attacks on Sunday, including bomb explosions at two churches -- the deadliest as Christmas mass ended near the capital Abuja -- and a suicide attack in the northeast.

A third church was targeted in the northeast on Christmas Eve, but no one was reported killed. Residents reported another explosion near a church in the northeastern city of Maiduguri late Sunday, but an army spokesman denied it.

The attack at St. Theresa Catholic Church in Madalla outside Abuja killed at least 35 and left a gruesome scene, with rescuers picking up body parts and putting them in plastic bags while emergency workers pleaded for ambulances.

Some of the wounded, including one man whose entrails protruded from his body, ran toward a priest for final blessings.

The attacks drew widespread condemnation, including from UN chief Ban Ki-moon, the United States and Britain.

Authorities and officials pledged to bring the attackers to justice, but the government in Africa's most populous nation has so far been unable to stop the Islamists, whose attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated and deadly.

President Goodluck Jonathan condemned the violence and his national security adviser called it ""unnecessary bloodletting by a group whose objectives are not in consonance with any genuine religious tenants.""

While the government blamed Boko Haram and a purported spokesman for the sect claimed responsibility for the violence, conflicting accounts emerged of both the investigation and the attack in Madalla.

A spokesman for police in Niger state, where Madalla is located, said on Monday that authorities had not yet determined who was behind the attack.

""We are looking beyond Boko Haram because other people bent on destabilising the government might be doing these things in the name of Boko Haram,"" said Richard Oguche.

Describing the attack, National Security Adviser Owoye Azazi said attackers threw improvised explosive devices from a moving vehicle in Madalla, adding that ""two of the criminals had been apprehended, caught in action.""

Oguche said no one was arrested and the blast occurred after a minibus pulled up near the church. He added that three police officers were among those killed.

""It was just about the time people were leaving the church and there was a (minibus),"" said Oguche.

""There were three police officers at the gate and they were trying to prevent those people from coming in. There was an argument and in the process the thing exploded.""

The attack sparked further chaos in the area, with angry youths setting fires and threatening to rush a police station. Police fired into the air to disperse them and cleared a road for rescue workers.

Other explosions occurred in the central city of Jos, where a church was targeted and policeman was killed in a resulting shootout, and in the northeastern city of Damaturu, where authorities have clashed with Islamists in recent days.

A suicide blast occurred in Damaturu when the bomber sought to ram into a military convoy in front of a secret police office, killing himself and three security agents. Sporadic gunfire broke out in the city on Sunday afternoon.

In Damaturu on Monday, hundreds of residents were seeking to flee, lining up at taxi and bus stands, seeking to take advantage of the momentary calm in the tense and violence-torn city.

Boko Haram had also claimed responsibility for a deadly wave of attacks in the Jos region on Christmas Eve last year.

Violence blamed on Boko Haram has steadily worsened in recent months, with bomb blasts becoming more frequent and increasingly sophisticated and death tolls climbing.

There has been intense speculation over whether Boko Haram has links with outside extremist groups, including Al-Qaeda's north African branch. It is believed to have a number of factions with varying aims.

Barely two days after some churches were destroyed in Christmas Day

bombing in Madalla, Niger State, an explosion on Wednesday rocked a

Quranic School located at the Sapele Central Mosque, Delta State

inflicting injuries on ten pupils.



Some of the badly injured victims were rushed to the University of Benin

Teaching Hospital, in nearby Edo State for medical attention.

It was gathered that the explosion which eyewitness said was a bomb

detonated at about 9.35 while the school was in session.



A source at the State Security Services, SSS, office in Sapele however

said the explosion was a dynamite, contrary to widespread believe that it

was a bomb.



Sapele Divisional Police Officer, Mr Emmanuel Ighodalo, would however

not comment on the incident but instead referred enquiries to Mr Charles

Muka, Delta State Police Public Relations Officer for reaction.

Owing to the profound injuries suffered by some of the victims, they could

not be treated at the Sapele General Hospital which lacked requisite

equipment to handle their cases.



While the badly injured victims were rushed to the University of Benin

Teaching Hospital, Benin City, others were conveyed to nearby Delta

State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara.



Chief Medical Director at Sapele General Hospital, Dr. Omo Aghoja,

confirmed that three of the victims were receiving treatment in the hospital.

When contacted, Muka confirmed the incident, clarified that no live was

lost in the incident. He disclosed that only six persons, namely five pupils

and an adult, were seriously injured and are currently receiving medical

attention.



He said preliminary investigation indicated that the explosion could have

been caused by a locally made explosive device.



According to him, more than 50 children, between the ages of seven and

15, were in the Islamic school receiving classes when the incident

occurred.



Assuring that the police would track down the culprits, he said some

hoodlums in the locality were into the manufacture of locally made

explosives in the area.



Chief Imam of Sapele Central Mosque, Alhaji Mohammed Usman in his

reaction said the blast was targeted at the pupils, but that God spared

their lives.

Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed, the Spokesman of the Joint Task Force (JTF), tagged Operation Restore Order (ODO) told newsmen in Maiduguri that the three persons killed in the city were knocked down by robbers while fleeing the market.

Mohammed said: ""Shortly after the Friday Prayers three suspected robbers stormed the Monday Market and attempted to dispossess traders of their money. But the JTF was alerted resulting in a hot chase and eventually heavy exchange of fire.""

He added, however, that the robbers decided to run after meeting the superior fire power of the soldiers.

""It was in the process of trying to escape that the robbers knocked down three civilians in the market.""

He said: ""Two of the victims died instantly, while the third sustained serious injuries and has been rushed to the hospital for attention."" He said he was not aware of any other casualty.

According to him: ""No any other person died or sustained injuries and no arrest has been made.""

Some of the traders at the market, however, told newsmen that the incident started with an explosion near a mosque at the market killing about three persons.

But sources at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) confirmed that three mutilated dead bodies were deposited at the mortuary but they declined to state if there were other casualties.

Also speaking on the attack, the Jama'atul Ahlis Sunna Wal Da'awti Wal Jihad known as the Boko Haram confirmed the angle that an explosion hit the market and claimed responsibility for the act.

Mallam Abu Qaqa spokesman of the group said in a telephone interview with some Maiduguri-based journalists that his group was responsible for the bomb blast at the market.

Lagos — One person was killed yesterday in Ilorin as spontaneous mass protests greeted the new year's sudden removal of petrol subsidy in the country.

The protests in which about 300 serving policemen participated in Lagos also took place in Kano, Benue and Oyo states among others. The Police Headquarters in Abuja described its personnel who protested as mutineers.

In Lagos, Nigerians protesting the subsidy removal and the over 150 per cent hike in the pump price of petrol shut down major parts of the state, including the ever-busy Ikorodu Road as vehicular movements were halted for over six hours.

This came as a Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP, (name withheld), descended heavily on junior police officers for not firing live bullets at un-armed protesters.

Led by leaders of Joint Action Front, JAF, and some labour leaders, the protesters chanted anti-government songs and made bonfires on Ikorodu Road. They said the protest was the beginning of a major revolution in the country.

Travellers who were taken unawares were trapped in the traffic gridlock while the protest lasted as they were prevented from either entering or leaving the state.

The protesters including Dr. Dipo Fashina, Chairman of JAF; Mrs Ganiat Fawehinmi, widow of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi; Femi Falana, Comrade Issa Aremu, Vice President of Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC; Secretary-General of Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, TUC, Chief John Kolawole; Vice Chairman of Lagos Council of NLC, Comrade Sanni Adeleke; Mr. Femi Aborishade, Senior Lecturer, Ibadan Polytechnic,and Comrade Abiodun Aremu, JAF Secretary, among others, moved from the Lagos office of NLC, in Yaba through Ojuelegba into Ikorodu road.

They displayed several anti-government placards some which read, ""99.9 per cent of Nigerians say no subsidy removal""; ""N65 per litre or revolution;"" "" we reject this wicked new year gift,"" ""deregulation is not the answer, build more refineries,"" ""Okonjo Wahala, IMF agent, leave now"", ""Jonathan: Tunisia revolution can happen here"", and ""Power belongs to the people.""

At Fadeyi, the atmosphere became charged as area boys set bonfire on both the major road and service lanes, thus causing panic among motorists who hurriedly made u-turns and sped off from the area.

An un-identified soldier was manhandled and injured by some area boys after he had a disagreement with them at Fadeyi, but was later rescued.

Also, a Thisday Photographer was rescued by the area boys from the hands of an overzealous policeman who wanted to seize his camera for taking shots of burning tyres on the road.

Though some policemen fired tear gas canisters at the protesters in Fadeyi, the incident did not deter them as they took over both sides of Ikorodu Road.

While most of the protesters were dispersing at Maryland, a Deputy Commissioner of Police arrived at the scene and descended on police officers who were guiding the peaceful procession for not shooting at them.

He was seen hitting the juniour police officers with his service pistol asking, ""why are you not shooting?""

Immediately, the policemen started firing tear gas canisters at the remaining protesters.

At Ojota, the protest almost resulted to violence as four protesters believed to have been earlier arrested by men of Operation MESSA, were spotted and the protesters insisted that they must be released.

Consequently, they surrounded the policemen and their two pick up vans and were about to descend on them when the four persons were released.

Addressing protesters earlier, JAF Secretary, Comrade Abiodun Aremu said: ""The struggle of June 2007, that reduced the price of petrol from N75 per litre to N65 per litre has just begun. It is on the account of that struggle that we are marching round the streets of Lagos to say no to further increase in the pump price of petroleum products.

""This protest which just commenced in Lagos today will hold across the 36 states of the country, starting with cities like Port Harcourt, Ibadan, Osogbo and Enugu among others.

Aremu said that there would be more protests today which would lead to barricading of roads just as bonfire would continue round the city of Lagos.

According to her the protest would ""continue until the Federal Government reverses the pump price of fuel to N65 per litre"", vowing that Nigerians ""must make the government to understand that the people in Aso Rock cannot determine their future.""

About 300 policemen had earlier in Lagos, staged a peaceful demonstration against the removal of fuel subsidy by the Federal Government even as the state Police Spokesman Mr Jinadu denied any knowledge of such protest.

Eyewitnesses, said the policemen demonstrated in the early hours of the day by marching through Oregun Road area of Ikeja and heading towards Alausa, the Lagos House, Ikeja, chanting anti-government slogans.

Barely 24 hours after bombs went off in Maiduguri and Damaturu respectively, gunmen late Thursday attacked a church in Gombe killing at least six people, the church's pastor says. Johnson Jauro said the killings took place when gunmen burst into his Deeper Life Church in the capital of Gombe state.

He said his wife was among those killed. Ten other people were injured. The nation has recently experienced a surge in ethnic and sectarian violence. Only recently President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in a number of local government areas in four states of the country. ""The attackers started shooting sporadically. They shot through the window of the church, and many people were killed including my wife,"" Jauro told Reuters news agency. ""Many members who attended the church service were also injured.""

No group said it carried out the attack, but the Islamist group Boko Haram recently carried out a string of bombings on Christmas Day, including against a church in the capital Abuja which killed dozens of people. Earlier on Thursday, two suspected members of Boko Haram were arrested after a father and son were killed in Maiduguri in neighbouring Borno state.

Attacks by Boko Haram have become increasingly frequent and are a major problem for security agencies. The President has vowed to ""crush"" the group. Several northern states surrounding Gombe have had their borders sealed off under the state of emergency declared by Jonathan following the Christmas bombings.

Boko Haram is fighting to create an Islamic state and wants to impose Sharia law across Nigeria. Followers of Boko Haram believe any political or social activity associated with Western values should be banned. This includes voting in elections, wearing shirts and trousers and receiving a secular education. Boko Haram regards the Nigerian state as being run by non-believers and this was the case even when the country had a Muslim president. - With the BBC"

Audu Bulama, one of the organisers of protests on Thursday, told AFP news agency, that about 300 people were wounded and 19 protesters arrested and later released.

""Around 1:15 this morning, the policemen assisted by local vigilantes fired tear gas on us, and when we refused to budge they used gun butts and cudgels to beat us while police vans ran into the crowd,"" he said.

Police were not immediately available for comment, but a spokesman had told local radio that the protest was ""illegal"" as it did not have police approval.

""There are procedures to be followed by any group that wants to hold any kind of protests,"" Kano police spokesman Magaji Majia said.

""The organisers of the protest must inform the police in writing, stating the date, time and venue of the protest, and secure police approval. Anything short of this is illegal.""

'Indefinite' strike

Nigeria has seen increasingly volatile demonstrations since the government announced the end of fuel subsidies on Sunday, causing petrol prices to instantly double in a country where most people live on less than two dollars per day.

The Nigerian government held an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the second day of mass protests, after one person was killed and more injured.

It resolved to provide hundreds of buses, among other resolutions, to cushion the impact of the subsidy, but it did not back down from its decision to remove the subsidy.

The unions rejected this and called for an ""indefinite"" national strike and mass demonstrations to shut down sectors such as oil production starting on Monday if the government did not restore the fuel subsidy.

""If the government fails to do so, they direct that indefinite general strikes, mass rallies and street protests be held across the country with the first on Monday, 9th January, 2012,"" the National Labour Congress and Trades Union Congress said in a joint statement released on Wednesday.

""All offices, oil production centres, air and sea ports, fuel stations, markets, banks, among others will be shut down.""

Ayo Johnson from Viewpoint Africa magazine told Al Jazeera that Nigerians are angry not only because of the subsidy cut but also because of the government's decision-making process.

""The government would say it has consulted with people over the last two months, but clearly, the consultation process has not been long enough,"" he said.

""People (are angry) that they're being penalised by a government who they've only recently put back in office.""

Violent protest

On Wednesday in Kano, hundreds of protesters shut down petrol stations and a mob threatened to burn a newspaper office before heading toward the state governor's office, when dozens of armed police and soldiers blocked them using trucks and vans.

The protesters occupied the city centre's main square, known as the Silver Jubilee Square, which protesters renamed ""Liberation Square"".

Protests in Kwara state led to the death of at least one person on Tuesday, with a union claiming police shot dead a protester while authorities said a mob killed him.

In Lagos on Tuesday, some 200 people marched on the highway and forced petrol stations to close.

A group of protesters in Kano threatened to burn down an office of the Daily Trust newspaper, whose coverage the protesters perceived as supportive of the government's move, but police blocked them.

""They came in hundreds with the intent to set ablaze our office,"" said Awwan Umar, Kano bureau chief for the newspaper.

'Politically suicidal'

Nigeria's government says it will transfer eight billion dollars it would save by cancelling the subsidy to much-needed infrastructure projects.

Even so, Oladipo Fashina, a union leader, has described the move as ""immoral and politically suicidal"" and has urged Nigerians to resist ""with everything they have"".

Previous attempts to even tamper with the subsidy have been met with nationwide protests.

President Goodluck Jonathan announced on Monday evening that he had set up a committee to ensure that the savings from the subsidy's end will be invested effectively to improve the lives of Nigerians.

The protests over rising fuel prices are only adding to Nigeria's security woes. In its northern cities three bomb blasts again hit Maiduguri and Damaturu on Wednesday, just days after the areas were placed under a state of emergency by the president.

A frightening dimension is creeping into the attacks being carried out in the north with 10 people from the eastern part of the country reported to have been killed by gunmen in Mubi, Adamawa State on Friday.

Local residents told the BBC those killed were Igbo residing in the state.

They had been meeting to organise how to transport the body of an Igbo man shot dead by gunmen on motorbikes on Thursday evening.

The local police chief said he believed Islamist group Boko Haram was behind the attack.

The militant group has staged numerous attacks in northern and central areas in recent months.

Recently the militant group had warned all southerners to leave the north.

On Thursday, at least six people were reportedly shot dead at a church in Gombe, Gombe State.

Mubi is in Adamawa state which borders Borno State, where the radical Islamist militants emerged.

Last month, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in some local council areas in Yobe, Borno, Plateau and Niger states following a surge in ethnic and sectarian violence.

Adamawa State Police Commissioner, Ade Shinaba told the AP news agency that he believed Boko Haram was behind the Mubi attack.

His spokesperson, Atine Daniel told the BBC officers were heading to the town to investigate the shooting.

She said at least 10 people had been killed in the shooting on Friday morning.

Members of the Igbo community in northern Nigeria often own shops and businesses.

The BBC's Abdullahi Tasiu in Yola, the capital of Adamawa State, said many Igbo traders in Mubi town are reported to have closed their shops Friday and are planning to flee the area.

The trouble began on Thursday night when two people were shot in a drive-by shooting.

Sources said relatives and friends of one of the victims organised a meeting to discuss how to raise money for the transportation of the dead body and funeral.

""It was while they were holding the meeting that gunmen came and opened fire on them,"" a resident told our reporter by phone, adding he believed ""a dozen"" people had been killed.

Most people in the area, both native residents and those from other states, were now living in total panic, our reporter says.

Another resident told our reporter that the number of killings by motorcycle-riding gunmen is increasing in the area.

The BBC Hausa Service said it had a report last week that an armed gang on motorcycles twice targeted a market in Mubi, shooting several people and stealing money."

A northern security guard was shot dead in a separate incident by a gang of armed robbers that attacked a school in Sapele on Thursday.

Vanguard gathered that the youths were incensed by the uninhibited attacks on churches and killing of Christians in the northern part of the country by the Islamic Boko Haram sect.

Two of the persons suspected to have carried out the onslaught were, however, arrested by the police in Sapele.

There was pandemonium following the attack on Muslims, who were ordered to vacate the town in their own interest since Boko Haram members had also issued ultimatum to Christians to leave the north.

Secretary of a Muslim Media group in Sapele, Sadiq Oniyesaneyene Musa who spoke to Vanguard on the attacks by Sapele youths said, ""We are disturbed by this attack on Muslims in Sapele and the order that all Muslims in Sapele should return to the north. I am a Muslim and an Itsekiri from Delta state, where do they want me to go to, this is my homeland"".

Musa said the youths besieged Muslims in the town very close to the mosque that was bombed, last year, and injured a lot of faithful.

""We called the director of the State Security Service, SSS, Asaba and the Area Commander and they responded. The Joint Task Force, JTF, on the Niger-Delta also deployed soldiers to take care of the situation"", he said."

BARELY 24 hours after about 29 persons were killed in Mubi, Adamawa State, gunmen, yesterday, struck again in the state, leaving three other persons dead.

The scene of the latest incident, according to reports, is Lamurde.

There were insinuations that yesterday's killings were politically motivated as the candidate of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state, slated for January 14, General Mohammed Buba Marwa, said they were designed to instil fear into the electorate ahead of the poll.

Also yesterday, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said the wanton killings in the north was ""an express invitation to civil war.""

The Friday incident had been linked to the Boko Haram sect which actually claimed responsibility while the killings came at the expiration of its ultimatum to Christians to leave the north.

In a broadcast to the people of Adamawa State, yesterday, Governor Murtala Nyako described the killings as criminal, saying they were unjustifiable.

The chairman of the Marwa Campaign Organisation in Lamurde, Aiseut Amuro, said that the three persons killed, yesterday, were supporters of his principal and members of the CPC in Adamawa State.

According to Amuro, some hoodlums at about 7. 30 pm, attacked the shop of a well known CPC supporter, a vulcanizer, set the shop on fire and burnt all the machines stored therein.

The hoodlums, said to number about 10 and brandishing dangerous weapons like axes, cutlasses,bows and arrows, later made for the house of another supporter and hacked him to death.

Another supporter had his hand cut off while two persons sustained serious injuries from knife wounds by the hoodlums.

In the early hours of yesterday, at about 1. 30am, there were further reports from Lamurde that two persons were killed by unknown hoodlums who invaded the area.

Fear of civil war

Christian Association of Nigeria, yesterday, warned that the wanton killing of Christians in some parts of the north was an express invitation to civil war, saying Christians now have to define means of defending themselves.

Arising from an emergency meeting in Abuja, CAN president, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor told newsmen that they would not make public their strategies. ""I don't ask them to carry arms but we have legitimate right to defend ourselves. We will do whatever it takes, we are working things out within ourselves, we are not obligated to tell you what we are working out, but let us wait and see"", Oritsajefor stated.

He went on: ""Declaring state of emergency in some local governments obviously has not done any good.

Definitely we are going to do what we have to do to protect ourselves. We can not seat back and watch people being slaughtered like animals, everyday, going to the church place of worship, shooting them, this is unacceptable"".

Meanwhile, the GENERAL Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, has expressed his heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones during the bomb blasts on Christmas Day and other violent attacks in the past year.

""Nigeria's future is very bright but the Devil is only trying to hinder and prevent our progress,"" the man of God was quoted as saying, adding that ""the brighter the future is, the angrier the devil becomes.""

According to the parish pastor of the headquarters church of RCCG, Pastor Goke Aniyeloye, the General Overseer has, in line with the rage of the devil, agreed to host a prayer summit to address the security situation in the country which will be tagged; ""A new beginning of greatness.""

The special prayer meeting will take place at the national headquarters of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, The Throne of Grace Parish in Ebute Metta, Lagos tomorrow.

He therefore enjoined all those lovers of the country and who desire peace to join in the prayer summit.

Bayelsa to northerners: Don't panic

In the meantime, as the fear of reprisal attack grips the Muslim community of northern extraction in southern part of the country, Bayelsa State government, yesterday, called on northerners, especially Muslims in the state and non-indigenes, not to be afraid of being attacked.

The appeal came on the heels of the weekend attack on the Muslim community of northern extraction in Sapele, Delta State and the exodus of persons of northern extraction from the state in the wake of the rising tension across the country.

Bayelsa State government, through the commissioner for information and strategy, Chief Nathan Egba, in a statement in Yenagoa, said, ""the Boko Haram threat to Christians in the North and indeed the general security issues in some parts of the country are challenges in a developing society like ours and will definitely be subdued with time.""

Bayelsans, he said, respect the secularity enshrined in the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which explains why there has not been and there will not be any crisis arising from differences in religion or worship. Security has been beefed up around settlements hosting the Muslim community of northern extraction in Yenagoa the state capital.

Armed police patrol team and men of the Nigeria Civil Defence and Security were yesterday noticed around the Aretalin area of Ovom with large concentration of the Muslim community.

The security presence notwithstanding, it was gathered that some of them (northerners) left in the last couple of days in the wake of the three days ultimatum issued by the dreaded Isalmic sect, Boko Haram, calling on northerners in the southern part of the country to return to home and southerners in the north to return to the south.

Muslims, Hausa told to remain in Rivers RIVERS State Governor Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi,yesterday, called on Muslims and Hausa resident in the state to go about their businesses, assuring that the government would ensure no harm befalls any one.

The governor, who spoke through his media aide, Mr Dave Iyofor, said the government was committed to promotion of peace and safety of lives of its citizens and residents in the state at all times.

""We are appealing to all residents of the state, particularly our Muslim brothers and sisters from the north to remain calm and go about their normal businesses because Rivers State is safe and the government is doing everything to ensure that it stays that way"", the governor said.

Meantime, unconfirmed reports said Hausa were moving out of the state for fear of reprisal attacks. But when Sunday Vanguard went round Mile One market most Hausa traders were seen still selling their wares.

Also on Okija Street, where most of them sell roast meat, called Suya in local parlance, they were seen doing their business. Some of them who spoke said they had no intention to relocate from the state. They also called for peace in all the north and other parts of the country.

Atiku condemns atrocities

Also yesterday, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar condemned in the strongest terms the latest round of ethnic and religious terrorist attacks in Jigawa, Gombe and in Mubi and Jimeta, Adamawa State, by yet to be identified gunmen.

Speaking to newsmen, shortly on arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Atiku said the killings were not only criminal and barbaric but also a dangerous threat to the unity of this country, especially coming two weeks after the terrorist attack on Christian worshippers at the St. Theresa Catholic Church at Madalla on Christmas Day.

This spiral of violence, he said, is unacceptable because it was targeted at destroying Nigeria's hard efforts to sustain unity in diversity.

The anger also fueled violence that pitted Christians against Muslims in Nigeria’s southwest, where five people were killed in attacks on a mosque and Quranic school.

At least six people were wounded in the attacks in Benin City, Nigerian Red Cross spokesman Nwakpa O. Nwakpa said. On Monday, a mob tried and failed to set a mosque ablaze.

The sectarian violence is among worrying signs of possible countrywide unrest in this nation divided into a mostly Christian south and Muslim north. A radical Islamist sect called Boko Haram has begun killing Christians in the nation’s northeast, leading to a call by a prominent Christian leader for worshippers to defend themselves.

The Benin City attack appeared to be a response to those killings.

“It looks like a reprisal from attacks in the north,” Nwakpa said. “They took advantage of protests.”

The nationwide strike, which began Monday, came after President Goodluck Jonathan removed subsidies on Jan. 1 that had kept gasoline prices low. Overnight, prices at the pump more than doubled, from $1.70 per gallon (45 cents per liter) to at least $3.50 per gallon (94 cents per liter). The costs of food and transportation also doubled in a nation where most live on less than $2 a day.

Jonathan insists the move was necessary to save the country an estimated $8 billion a year, which he promises will go toward badly needed road and public projects. However, protesters — who joined the strike under the slogan of “Occupy Nigeria” — say the time has come to end government corruption in a nation where military rulers and politicians have stolen billions.

More than 10,000 people gathered Tuesday at a park in Lagos, where protests were mostly peaceful. However, crowds were tense elsewhere in the city of 15 million.

Dr. Tayo Konolafe, a gynecologist, led a group of young protesters, shouting that he would be ready to abandon his career and “hold a gun” to bring change in the country.

“Everybody is angry. A hungry man is an angry man,” Konolafe declared. “What we are passing through in Nigeria is not poverty — it is penury.”

Whether the government can hold back nationwide unrest remains unclear. Soldiers are deployed now in the country’s restive central region over fears of ethnic and religious violence, in its northeast to fight Boko Haram and in its oil-rich southern delta to stop militancy. Those operations have had mixed success, while critics say the country’s police force is more focused on collecting bribes from civilians than protecting them.

“I will not say it is easy, but we are trying to contain it,” said Moses Onireti, a police spokesman in Oyo state, where a dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed to try to control violence. “These protesters are everywhere, everywhere.”

Unrest could affect oil production in Nigeria, which produces about 2.4 million barrels of oil a day and is a top crude supplier to the U.S. However, most fields remain unmanned and offshore oil fields provide much of its capacity. Unions representing some oil workers have promised to strike, but it is unclear what effect on production that has had.

The strike has closed Lagos’ busy Apapa Port, cutting off cargo shipments. Businesses remain shuttered, while air carriers canceled more international flights. Organizers say the strike will continue until the government restores the subsidies.

Meanwhile, anger in the street continues unabated. At the Ikoyi Island roadblock, a convoy of police escorting a member of the country’s elite arrived, with officers loudly loading their Kalashnikov rifles in an attempt to drive the protesters away. Officers put out part of the flaming blockade with an extinguisher, then drove off, leaving the protesters behind.

Another convoy of unarmed officers arrived. They pleaded for calm but the protesters instead threw stones as the officers struggled to put out the flames.

“They will kill us and we will kill them!” the protesters shouted.

By Our Reporters

Three persons were confirmed dead Tuesday in Ogun and Osun States as the strike declared by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and its allies to protest the removal of subsidy on petrol by the Federal Government enters day three today.

One of the two victims, simply identified as Kaola, a diesel seller at Kara, Ibafo in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State, was, according to a witness, allegedly shot on the upper and left chest by the police. The other victim’s identity was still shrouded in secrecy as at press time last night.

However, as at the time of this report, the state police command had been mute on the veracity of the allegation by protesters that the victims were shot by its officers.

The Ibafo axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway was earlier blocked by the protesters, causing huge traffic build up with many motorists and other road users stranded for hours.

In Osun, another state in the South-west geo-political zone of the country, a protester identified as Raheem Mojeed, was confirmed killed in Osogbo, the state capital.

Mojeed, popularly called ‘Apampa’ by his friends, was a member of one of the civil society groups that spearheaded the anti-fuel subsidy removal protest in the state.

The victim reportedly died after he allegedly received machete cuts inflicted on him on Monday by a man identified as ""Lawrence the law"" who was believed to be a political thug.

In Oyo State, a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Akin Olajide, said a 7pm-to-7am curfew has been imposed on the state.

He said the action became necessary to protect the lives of the people of the state. And in Lagos, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has threatened to shut down the upstream sector of the oil industry should President Goodluck Jonathan continue to pay deaf ears to the cries of Nigerians.

Chairman of the Lagos Council of PENGASSAN, Rev. Folorunsho Oginni, who stated this in Lagos, warned that the strike and mass protests was degenerating to a level where oil workers would be forced to withdraw members from the rigs and export terminals as their continued presence was being threatened.

The protest in Ekiti State took a different dimension Tuesday as youths displayed a mock coffin with an inscription: “R.I.P Oil Subsidy”.

In Rivers State, Governor Chibuike Amaechi has said the removal of fuel subsidy by President Jonathan is to rescue the country’s economy from collapse.

Amaechi stated this while addressing a rally organised by the NLC, Trade Union Congress (TUC) and civil society groups in Port Harcourt Tuesday.

He said Jonathan has good intentions for the country in spite of the deregulation of the petroleum sector.

“If you we don't support the president to remove oil subsidy, we will not even be able to buy clothes because the dollar will escalate to N250 per dollar.

“That is what the thing is going to. So, the president is not a wicked man, he is on a rescue mission.

“Let me tell you, which president will not be taking that kind of a decision in this very difficult moment of Nigerian history?” he asked.

Residents of Calabar, Cross River State, groaned aloud yesterday over the growing effect of the anti-fuel subsidy removal strike by labour.

As against the first day, the residents felt the effect of the protest as economic and commercial activities of the state were grounded.

Delta State was generally calm as the volume of vehicular traffic rose appreciably; but most social and economic activities were still at low ebb.

But in Edo State, leaders of the NLC and the TUC have suspended the ongoing protests in the state, but advised the residents to participate in the strike from their homes.

The Abia State Government yesterday made efforts to break the strike which was yet to attain total compliance by asking workers in its employ to return to their duty posts.

However, traders in Onitsha, Anambra State, have continued to shun the ongoing nationwide strike, pushing ahead with their business activities.

A correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) monitoring the strike reported that markets, shops and other business activities were in full swing as the strike entered its second day.

Residents of the city went about their businesses with commercial vehicle operators providing services while pupils and students in private schools were seen going to school.

In Owerri, the capital of Imo State, the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Owerri, provided skeletal medical services for emergency situations but doctors did not attend to pregnant women, who went for the routine ante-natal at the hospital on Orlu Road in the city.

A medical practitioner at the hospital, Dr. Cornelius Amajioyi, said that only emergency cases were handled because of the strike.

All businesses remained shut in Makurdi, Benue State on day two of the subsidy removal protest.

The peaceful protest led by the state chairman of the NLC, Comrade Simon Anchaver, saw hundreds of the protesters matching through major streets in the town under the close watch of military personnel and men of the state Police Command.

In the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the protest witnessed much crowds participating than was the case within the city on Monday. Yesterday’s rally and procession started about 10.30am from the popular Julius Berger Junction.

Commercial activities were to a great extent stalled and paralysed the usually busy activities in and around Wuse, Asokoro, Maitama and Garki. This is because all through the hours of 10am to after 12 noon, nothing tangible took place. If the measure of success of the NLC/TUC declared strike is to be judged with the closure of shops, then, it could be declared a success because much people attended the rallies.

The police in Bauchi, Bauchi State, yesterday deployed hundreds of its men in various strategic places in the metropolis while other security personnel were deployed in some major roads to guard against violence.

THISDAY gathered that the combined military and police patrol teams were still patrolling major roads of the state capital, especially black spots and areas where banks, major commercial and government institutions were located.

The level of compliance in Adamawa State has drastically reduced. NAN reported that except for government offices and banks, private businesses including some filling stations, were opened for business.

NAN correspondents, who went round the state capital, reported that commercial motorcyclists and bus drivers were conveying passengers to their various destinations.

Reports from local government areas across the state also indicated that the situation was the same.

The drivers, however, complained of low patronage as most people stayed at home.

In Maiduguri, Borno State, economic activities remained paralysed yesterday as the anti-subsidy strike entered day two. In the state capital, all markets were closed and their gates placed under lock and key.

Business premises and government offices yesterday remained shut in Gombe, Gombe State, as the strike over the removal of fuel subsidy entered its second day.

It was observed at the Bauchi Road Motor Park in Gombe, that commercial vehicles were not operating, most business outfits remained under lock, while a few vehicles and motorcycles were seen plying the roads.

In Gusau, Zamfara State, public and commercial activities in the state remained grounded.

Government offices, banks, markets and motor parks were shut, while streets were deserted, following heavy security presence within the municipality.

Youths were seen playing football on the roads deserted by motorists.

Some protesters took advantage of the demonstration on Monday to vandalise public properties, including two pick-up vans belonging to security operatives.

Following the violence, which trailed Monday’s protest against the removal of fuel subsidy in Gusau, the Zamfara Government has accused politicians of instigating the destruction of public property.

A statement by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication, Alhaji Sani Tsafe, said: “Some politicians hide under the cover of the ongoing strike to cause havoc in the state.”

Meanwhile, the state government has announced restriction of movements except for people on essential services between 7am to 7pm, following the skirmishes recorded on Monday. The Kebbi State Government has released 200 vehicles on loan to the state branch of the NURTW to cushion the effect of the fuel subsidy removal.

The union on its part, immediately announced a reduction in transport fares by 15 per cent.

Governor Saidu Dakingari said in Birnin Kebbi while addressing a procession of protesters, that the vehicles were “highly subsidised”.

The Coalition of Civil Societies, labour unions and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) in Kaduna State Tuesday suspended the street protests against the removal of fuel subsidy, directing all residents of the state and protesters to remain at home and await further directives.

The directives came following the activities of hoodlums who have taken over the streets raising serious security concern in the volatile city.

Since the commencement of the protest on Monday, some miscreants have been looking for an opportunity to hijack it and cause crisis.

Yesterday, commercial and business activities in the city remained grounded as residents stayed home. The streets were deserted except for hoodlums who were seen going about menacingly in places like Ahmadu Bello Way, Warf Road and other streets, chanting unprintable slogans.

The Kano State chapter of the NLC suspended yesterday’s protest march to mourn those who lost their lives during Monday’s clash with riot policemen.

State Chairman of the council, Comrade Isa Yunusa Danguguwa, told THISDAY yesterday, that “the idea behind the suspension of today’s (yesterday) protest is to mourn those killed during the protest in Kano”, but added that “it does not invalidate the strike as we will continue with it”.

He called on workers in both public and private sectors to remain at home.

THISDAY also observed that the Nigeria Air Force helicopter was hovering over the airspace to forestall a repeat of Monday’s ugly incident.

Normalcy has since returned to the city, while government has imposed curfew from 6pm to 8am as part of efforts to avert any breakdown of law and order."

The killing spree by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram continued Wednesday, as four Igbos, including a woman fleeing from the crisis-ridden Maiduguri to the South-east were waylaid and killed at Potiskum, Yobe State, by gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram.

Also on the same day, three people were feared killed by unknown gunmen in renewed overnight attack at Pyakman village in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of Bauchi State.

According to sources in Potiskum, the victims who were travelling in a 14-seater bus, a yellow Mitsubushi 300 with registration number Anambra XE 241 NSE, were attacked by the gunmen at MRS filling station, around Texaco area, while trying to refuel at about 11.30a.m. Wednesday.

Sources told THISDAY that the assailants came on two motorcycles as if wanting to buy fuel when they took position and before anyone could sense their motive, they brought out AK 47 riffles and opened fire on the victims.

The source said: ""You know Igbos are being hated unjustly in this area and moreso they are Christians not like the Yorubas that you find some Muslims among even though they too were being targeted as per they are not northerners.""

He added that: ""Even northerners that are Christians are being targeted by these groups not to talk of somebody that came from the south east or west. I think this country is heading towards civil war again and I don't think it is good for the north.""

Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Abdulkadir Song, said four Igbos from initial police findings left Maiduguri on Wednesday morning and were heading for the east before they were shot dead by Boko Haram gunmen at Potiskum when they stop to refuel.

Similarly, the people living around Jajeri ward of Maiduguri Metropolis have reported an explosion in their area. According to them, they did not know whether or not there were casualties in the explosion, but they feared that, it was targeted at men of the Joint Tasked Force (JTF) on 'Operation Restore Order' patrolling the area.

The two deafening bomb blasts occurred at few minutes after 6p.m. and was greeted with sporadic gun fires which left residents scampering for safety.

Attempts to get confirmation was futile as calls to the GSM lines of both the JTF field operation officer, Col. Victor Ebhaleme and the spokesman of the JTF Lt. Col. Hassan Mohammed were not reachable perhaps the phones were switched off.

Meanwhile, the Bauchi State Police Commissioner, Mr Ikechukwu Ayo Aduba, who confirmed the incident yesterday, said the area was now calm and under control, adding that the incident was being investigated.

But Secretary of Sayawa Elders Council, Mr. Bukata Zhadi, while speaking with journalists in Bauchi, said some suspected gunmen killed three people and allegedly removed their eyes.

According to him, the deceased had gunshots and machete cuts on their bodies.

""The deceased went to the village to see their lands and they were attacked and killed, we have reported the incident to police in Tafawa Balewa and in company of soldiers went and removed the corpses of the deceased from the bush and deposited their corpses at Tafawa Balewa General Hospital,"" he said.

Speaking further, he said: ""We don't know the importance of the security agents deployed to the area, they were there and our people are being attacked and killed by assailants.""

It would be recalled that there has been recurring of such killings in Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro to date.

The area is also regarded as a flash point by security agencies because of the frequent clashes between Hausa, Fulani and Sayawa communities in the area.

KANO, Nigeria — Gunmen have attacked two pubs in northeastern Nigeria, killing four people amid a wave of such violence blamed on Islamist group Boko Haram, residents and police said Saturday.

The attacks occurred in two neighbouring states on Friday night and involved gunmen riding on motorcycles storming in on the drinking spots.

""Unknown gunmen attacked a beer parlour at BCJ (a district) and killed two persons,"" Gombe state police spokesman Ahmed Mohammed said on the phone.

Umar Dukku, a resident in the area said two gunmen stormed into the bar and fired indiscriminately. One person was wounded in the attack.

""They just fired into the beer parlour and zoomed off on the motorcycle they parked outside,"" Dukku said.

In nearby Adamawa state two gunmen arrived on a motorbike and opened fire on an open-air pub in the Dandu area in the state capital Yola late Friday, also wounding a policeman while fleeing.

""We took two dead bodies of the victims to the hospital last night,"" local community leader Tijjani Tukur said. ""The gunmen arrived in the area and opened fire on people drinking at the open air tavern.""

Adamawa state police spokeswoman Altine Daniel confirmed the attack but said only a policeman was injured.

""There was an attack on an outdoor beer joint by some gunmen last night in which a policeman was shot in the leg and is being treated in hospital,"" Daniel said.

Adamawa has been hit by a series of such attacks in recent days, with much of the violence blamed on the radical Islamist Boko Haram.

However, the state holds governorship elections on January 2l, with campaign periods often provoking violence in Nigeria.

Yola was also targeted last week when gunmen opened fire on worshippers at a church, killing at least eight people. On Wednesday, gunmen attacked a police station in the city, leaving one officer dead.

Also last week, gunmen opened fire on Christian Igbos at a house in the town of Mubi in Adamawa as they mourned the death of a friend killed in a shooting the night before, leaving 17 dead.

Adamawa was also hit by an attack late Thursday on a Muslim village by a suspected Christian mob from a nearby community which left two dead and several homes and mosques burnt.

A curfew has been declared in Yola and other trouble spots.

Spiralling violence in Nigeria, most of it blamed on Boko Haram, has sparked fears of a wider conflict in a country roughly divided between a mainly Muslim north and predominately Christian south.

THE police confirmed, on Monday, the killing of three Chadians in Damaturu by gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram.

Besides, Qaqa also referred reporters to an e-mail message in which Imam Muhammad Abubakar Shekau, Spiritual Head of the sect, threatened that: ""Unless urgent steps are taken, the group will launch endless and violent attacks on Kano and its environs because of arbitrary arrest and persecution of his members.""

Vanguard learnt that in the said e-mail, Shekau said the group had written an open letter to the people of Kano, including the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Ado Bayero; Governor Musa Kwankwaso, Alhaji Aminu Dantata and Khalifa Sheikh Isiaka Rabiu on recent happenings in the ancient city.

Shekau revealed that but for the intervention of some prominent scholars in Kano, his group would have made the city ungovernable a long time ago.

Alleges persecution

Qaqa said: ""The message here is that everybody knows that a lot of our people were killed in Kano State, especially in Wudil town. We had perfected plans to take revenge but some notable scholars intervened by pleading with us.

""They also assured that our members would nevear be persecuted again and we took them by their words.

""Again, we perfected plans to attack the city of Kano but the scholars pleaded that we should not.

""We also posted the open letter on the internet, but nothing was done to stop the persecution of our members.

""Some of our members were tortured with electric shock. All these things happened in Kano, a city that we hold in high esteem.

""We have varied opinions about Kano, including the option of launching endless campaign of violence, but the scholars that have been talking to us are still persuading us to tarry a while.

Nigeria : Boko Haram Bombs Kano, Kill Channels TV Man

Musa Diso and Suleiman Abdul-Azeez

TERRORISTS suspected to be members of dreaded Islamic sect, Boko Haram, bombed the headquarters of Nigeria Police Force, Kano State, killing scores, including Channels Television correspondent, Enenche Akogwu and injuring many others.

They also unleashed terror on the State Security Services and Immigration Headquarters in the city killing and injuring people.

Terrorists, who engaged the policemen there in a gun duel stormed the state police command headquarters in Bompai.

Security sources said the gunmen had earlier attacked the Immigrations office at Farm Centre.

The attack at the police headquarters, according to report, was carried out by a suicide bomber driving a Honda Civic car.

The bomber, according to the report, succeeded in breaking through the gates of the building and rammed the car into the wall of a vocational centre in which wives of police officer learn sewing.

The building, which was completely destroyed is adjacent to the office of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 1.

At least, 30 others suffering from varying degrees of injuries have been taken to different hospitals across the state.

A witness, Garba Danazumi Lere, said he saw the bodies of three police officers and a local journalist after blast at the police zonal headquarters.

A second blast went off at the SSS headquarters along Sardauna Crescent after a first blast caused the security agents to cordon off the immediate vicinity of their office.

There have also been reports of an explosion at a motor park along New Road in Sabon Gari area and another police station at Yarakwa along Zaria road.

These added to the number of explosions and gun attacks that rocked the city yesterday evening.

Casualty figures from these sites are not yet known.

At the SSS headquarters, it was said that one of the attackers was killed and a second arrested in an earlier attack.

According to an orange seller who was selling oranges close to the Immigration office when the attack on that office started, the attackers were two in number.

'I was peeling my oranges when all of a sudden two men walked to the building and began shooting at the immigration personnel there. I saw at least three of them fall before I ran for cover,' he narrated.

It was after the shooting that the explosions began, he said.

A resident in Tarauni described a very thick dark cloud of smoke in the sky visible from his location to our reporter, most likely coming from the explosion at Ungwar Uku.

Immigrations spokesman, Mohammed Kanoma, said at least three officials were killed, as well as an unknown number of civilians in the attack.

The fresh explosions are happening two days after the alleged mastermind of the Christmas Day bombing of St. Theresa's Church in Madalla, in Suleja escaped from police custody.

The BBC Hausa-language service claimed that a spokesman for the Boko Haram sect claimed the Friday's attacks across Kano, where at least four bombs exploded.

Obviously infuriated by the clampdown on members of the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), by the Army in Onitsha Anambra state, which led to the killing of three of their member last Sunday, the movement has given the Military High Command 48 hours to affect the release of their members including the corpses of those killed and immediate stopage of their harrassment.

The Movement's spokesman, Comrade Uchenna Madu, stated that the Army has provoked MASSOB members through their unwarranted killings and detention of their members, warning that, ""if the ultimatum is not heeded, the Army and the Nigerian state will see the violent side of MASSOB"".

The visibly agitated Madu maintained that the non-violent posture of MASSOB has been mistaken for weakness by security operatives, ""who now derive joy in the killing and intimidation of unarmed MASSOB members"".

""The current security challenges the country is grappling with as a result of the Boko Haram menace will be a child's play at the expiration of our ultimatum. We will declare war against the Army except our members that are currently in detention in different military facilities and police cells in Anambra state and entire South East are released unconditionally"", he fumed.

Madu who gave graphic details of how soldiers attacked and killed some members of MASSOB in Onitsha on Sunday said that the soldiers were on a rescue mission of a man who deals on Idian hemp that was arrested by MASSOB members and handed over to the police in Onitsha.

He alleged that the man was an agent of some officers in the barrack and immediately he contacted them they moved to Okpoko police station, a surburb of Onitsha and set him free before they began the manhunt of MASSOB members at their meeting venues

Madu said that it was at Port Harcourt road by Silas Works road that they shot and killed three of their members who resisted their arrest.

Corroborating MASSOB's stance, the newly crowned ""Ogirisi-Igbo (defender of the igbos), Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka, said that the MASSOB members who were killed by the Army in Onitsha , were on their way to a meeting to fine tune arrangements for the burial of late Dim Odimegwu Ojukwu.

Describing the incident as provocative, the Igbo leader warned that the actions of the Army which he said was a systematic clampdown of Igbo youths, will have dire consequences if it is allowed to continue.

""We have endured the killing of Ndigbo in the North without reprisal attacks in the East. But we are being pushed to the wall by the Army in our own land. What have they done to the Boko Haram sect who are known enemies of the state. We are waiting to see what government will do otherwise we may resort to self defense"", he sounded

But the Commander of the 302 Artillery Regiment Onitsha, Brig. General J. Abuka, denied that the Army killed MASSOB members, stating that if its true they should bring the corpses for people to see.

(Photo Courtesy Leadership Boko Haram Kano Attacks: 215 Dead, Still Counting.

There appears to be no let up in the Boko Haram onslaught on Kano, with fresh explosions and gunfire reported early Tuesday in an area near a police station in the city.

On Friday, it was the same Kano that bore the brunt of coordinated attacks and shootouts claimed by the Islamic sect, which left at least 185 dead.

According agency reports, some 15 blasts and gunshots were heard coming from the vicinity of a mobile police headquarters on Tuesday morning. Details were not immediately clear, and police were not available for comment.

""I was awoken from sleep by explosions and gunshots coming from the mobile barracks and police station opposite,"" one resident told the AFP, adding that they had stopped after several minutes.

""It's terrifying ... It's too dangerous to go out, besides there is curfew.""

Sporadic gunfire could still be heard after the explosions halted.

A night time curfew is in effect in the wake of Friday's attacks in Kano claimed by Islamist group Boko Haram.

The fresh violence came after police foiled attacks in the city Monday, discovering 10 bomb-laden cars and hundreds of other unexploded devices from the wave of deadly violence last week.

The same day the grim discoveries were made, clerics held prayers for peace after the attacks on Friday.

President Goodluck Jonathan vowed to beef up security as he grapples with a surge in violence by the Islamist sect Boko Haram blamed for the attacks and mounting social discontent.

Kano was left reeling after bombs were set off and gun battles raged in coordinated strikes after Friday prayers that targeted mainly police buildings, including the police headquarters.

Details began to emerge of the mode of the attacks, with police announcing the discovery of large numbers of explosive devices and that at five of the assailants were suicide bombers.

Twenty-nine of the dead were police officers, the state's Police Commissioner, Ibrahim Idris said in a statement, while witness testimony said some of the assailants wore police uniforms.

Idris said police found 10 cars loaded with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at various sites in Kano, along with about 300 drinks cans, eight powdered milk tins and eight 350-kilogramme drums -- all loaded with explosives.

According to the latest toll, he said 150 civilians, three intelligence officers, two immigration officers and a customs officer were, in addition to the police officers, killed in Friday's attacks.

""I will pray to God that we should never re-live the catastrophe that resulted in the deaths and maiming in our city,"" Kano State governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso said as about 200 Muslim clerics and political leaders offered peace prayers in Kano.

Nobel literature laureate, Wole Soyinka, who has previously warned of the risk of civil war, appealed to fellow Nigerians not to exact revenge.

""We must not accept the agenda of Boko Haram. Do not consider reprisals,"" Soyinka said. ""They want... to embark on a programme where neighbours will turn against neighbours.""

Political leaders also sought to ensure that the attacks do not spark a wider conflict in Nigeria.

""We want to ensure that a few misguided Nigerians who have been led into this action don't take this country hostage,"" said Senate president David Mark who travelled to Kano with the speaker of the House of Representatives Aminu Tambuwal.

A purported spokesman for Boko Haram said the attacks were in response to a refusal by the authorities to release its members from custody.

Some detainees being held at a police station in Kano were thought to have been freed during Friday's attacks.

The group, which has staged a series of increasingly sophisticated and bloody attacks, often targeting Christians, is believed to have a number of factions with differing aims, including some with political links and a hard-core Islamist cell.

President Jonathan has said some Boko Haram members have infiltrated government, including the security services and the executive.

In Kano, around 50 people gathered Monday outside the main hospital's morgue waiting to collect remains of their loved ones for burial.

Most of the recent major attacks blamed on the sect have occurred in the northeast of the country, with many taking place despite the state of emergency.

Boko Haram has also claimed a Christmas Day bombing at a church near the capital Abuja which killed at least 44 people and an August attack against UN headquarters in Abuja that killed 25.

Another explosion, from a burst tyre at Sabon Gari market, yesterday, afternoon caused pandemonium as people thought it was another bomb blast.

The Improvised Explosive Devise, IED, went off between two long buses at a motor park along New Road, Kano, triggering pandemonium.

Eyewitness told Vanguard that the explosive, stuffed in an empty soft drink can, was thrown by unknown persons between commercial buses operated by two transport companies, Gobison Bus and Ezenwata Motors.

The explosion was said to have shattered the glasses in one of the buses, while two people sustained slight injuries in the pandemonium that ensued.

The eyewitness said as soon as the dust settled, transporters evacuated their buses from the park in anticipation of more bomb blasts.

Soldiers, who arrived the scene immediately cordo-ned off the area and commenced investigations into the remote causes of the explosion.

A soldier keeping watch at the eastern end of the new road told Vanguard: ""We had a blast at the park and two people were feared injured. The police bomb disposal unit is inside conducting their investigation.""

A resident in the area, who also spoke to Vanguard on the incident, said: ""We heard a blast, rushed in there to see what happened and saw two people slightly injured. They were taken to the hospital.""

Also, two other civilians were reportedly injured, as the sect members bombed the Gambouru/Ngala police station, the Joint Task Force, JTF, check point. The incident was said to have occurred at about 6.30 pm. Gambouru/Ngala is a border town with Chad Republic and 150 kilometres North-East of Maiduguri, the state capital.

To cripple the sect, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika, yesterday, canvassed decisive actions against it, warning that the earlier the government took the bull by the horn and acted decisively, the better for the future of the nation. He anchored the need for decisive steps on the fact that the menace had spread to other parts of West Africa.

Ihejirika's warning came on a day the Department of State Security Service (SSS) quizzed immediate past Governor of Kano State, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau over his alleged involvement in the sponsorship of the sect.

Time to deal with sect - Ihejirika

Welcoming members of the House of Representatives Committee on Internal Security to Army Headquarters, Ihejirika said Boko Haram and other security issues could not be solved by a wave of the hand.

He thanked the National Assembly for its concern for the well-being of the country. He said that the Nigerian Army remained apolitical and committed to the job of supporting civil authorities to enhance security.

He reiterated his call on the citizenry to provide all the support required by those in arms to serve the nation better.

Noting that soldiers were the representatives of Nigerians when it comes to the force of arms, he said, ""you need to recall the phrase that war is of such importance that it cannot be left in the hands of the security agencies alone, just as national security issues cannot be left in the hands of service personnel alone.""

The Army boss urged all well meaning Nigerians to aid the crusade, expose evil among the people so that the problem could be nipped quickly for the nation to move forward.

""I can tell you that this development; even the problem of Almajiri and so on cannot be solved just by a wave of the hand. So we are delighted to have you in our midst and note your resolve at working with us to solve this problem at hand.""

Continuing he said, ""we are also looking beyond the confines of this country; the whole of the West African region is looking up to this country to find a solution to the menace of Boko Haram because it is no longer news that the Boko Haram issue is not limited to the confines of our borders and the earlier they act decisively, the better for the future of this nation.""

Maiduguri killings

Confirming the Maiduguri attacks, the Borno State Police Public Relations Officer, Samuel Tizhe said, the attacks were simultaneously carried out at both the Air Force Barracks and the Gambouru/Ngala police station between 6pm and 6.30 pm, adding that the suspected gunmen attacked one of the apartments in the barracks and fired several gun shots at the soldier, who was returning to the house in mufti.

According to the police, the sect members also, killed two other civilians resident in the barracks after killing the soldier in mufti. The Gambouru/Ngala police station was attacked with guns and other explosive devices, killing the two police officers on duty, and injuring two others, on their way to the office.

Gambouru/Ngala is one of the five local governments in Borno where President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency on December 31, last year.

The police spokesman said the bodies of the soldier and two civilians have been deposited at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, UMTH, for identification by their relations.

He however said that no arrests had been made over the attacks but investigations were on going.

The Fields Operations Officer of JTF, Col. Victor Ebhaleme said that no soldier was killed at the Polo military checkpoint attacks, adding that the only soldier who was shot in the arm had been treated and discharge from the UMTH."

About 10 people were severely injured on Saturday, when thugs from rival factions of the Nkpor town union clashed over the collection of levies from traders at the Nkpor Main Market in Idemili North Local Government Area.

The thugs freely used firearms and machetes on themselves as traders scampered to safety, SUNDAY PUNCH gathered.

The peace of the town has been disrupted for several years following disagreements over the leadership of the town union.

Witnesses to the Saturday clash said the violent clash occurred when a group of boys armed with guns, machetes and clubs attacked revenue collectors from the new caretaker committee of the town union at the Nkpor main market.

The Chairman of the town union’s caretaker committee, Mr. Chuma Chukwurah, told reporters that the crisis in the community was caused by the refusal of the former caretaker committee, led by Mr. Raphael Nnabuife to leave office after the expiration of their tenure.

He said Nnabuife, who is also the Transition Committee Chairman of Idemilli North Local Government, “has continued to frustrate all efforts to settle the leadership crisis in the town because of the huge revenue they were raising from the markets and other businesses in the community.”

Chukwurah said, “The other faction who are bent on frustrating all genuine efforts by the community to achieve peace went to the market and drove our people who were collecting revenue from the market.”

But Nnabuife said the group claiming to be caretaker committee of the community was not recognised by the leadership of the community or government. He described them as a “group of bandits who have been troubling the peace of the community for a very long time.”

He confirmed that although the tenure of his administration had expired late last year, he was reappointed to continue for another three months when the union’s election was disrupted last year by the same group of people.

The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Emeka Chukwuemeka, however told our correspondent that he had yet to be briefed about the incident."

...As another explosion hit Maiduguri

From TIMOTHY OLA, Maiduguri

Tuesday, February 07, 2012

Two people have been shot dead in Maiduguri by gunmen suspected to be of Boko Haram sect barely 48 hours after the killing of an ex-local government chairman in the state, even as another explosion hit metropolis yesterday evening.

The killing, according to Daily Sun findings occurred at about 10:00pm on Sunday night in a house at Ummarari ward beside the 7Up depot. It was gathered that the assailants had stormed the house in the night and headed straight for the apartment of their targets and thereafter shot them.



“You know the other occupants of the house have fled before we got there yesterday but somebody told us that the gunmen came at about 10:00pm in the night when everybody was asleep. They said the killers went to the first target, an Ebira man called Dele from Kogi State, since his apartment was closer to the main entrance leading to the house. They then headed for Mr Ore’s room and shot him too. I am just coming from the place and as I am talking to you now, his corpse is still lying on the floor in front of his room,” one of the deceased family friend told Daily Sun.



It was gathered that one of the deceased who was identified as Mr. Ore from Kabba in Kogi State was already planning to relocate to his home town before the incident occurred. “He had initially refused to relocate with his family last year when they were going, but his younger brother wanted him to leave Maiduguri at all cost and that was why the brother promised to send money to him this week so that he can park his belongings. Unfortunately, we have informed the brother now that the man has been killed,” the family member said.



Daily Sun observed that most residents of the area were not even aware of the incident yesterday until mid-day. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Samuel

Tizhe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, when contacted said the command was yet to receive the report of the killing. The Joint Task Force (JTF) could not also react to the incident as at the time of filing this report.

Meanwhile, multiple explosions hit Maiduguri metropolis hours after the news of the Sunday killing filtered into the city.

Residents were thrown into anxiety, as people within the Gamboru Market around the Custom areas ran toward different directions, following the blast, while thick smoke billowed from the area.

Sources said the explosion which occurred at about 4:00pm might have been planted in drainage around the area. But an official of the Joint Task Force (JTF) who would not want to be quoted said an electric machine which gutted by fire caused the billowing smoke.

After almost a year of silence, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) rose from the ashes and struck Saturday night in Brass Local Government Area, Bayelsa State, leading to the destruction of a crude oil trunk line belonging to Italy's oil multinational subsidiary in Nigeria, Agip.

In a statement signed by its spokesman, Jomo Gbomo, MEND claimed responsibility for the attack, which the militia group said occurred at 1930hrs on Saturday, forewarning that there will be several other attacks aimed at shutting down Nigeria's oil production and targeting South African interests in the country.

South African companies operating in Nigeria that have been targeted by MEND include the country's telecoms giant MTN and SacOil, an oil and gas company operating in the Niger Delta, among others.

Providing insight on what to expect, MEND said: ""In the dark days to come, MTN, SacOil and other South African investments will pay a heavy price for the interference of Jacob Zuma in the legitimate fight for justice in the Niger Delta, by its people.""

But in what threatens to snowball into an international incident, South Africa's Minis-try of International Relations and Cooperation said yesterday that it would investigate threats against South African companies with investments in Nigeria by MEND.

On the Agip attack, MEND warned that ""this relatively insignificant attack is a reminder of our presence in the creeks of the Niger Delta and a sign of things to come.

""We have constantly warned Nigerians about Goodluck Jonathan and his train of idiots running Nigeria. Events of the last few months have vindicated our position on the inability of this moron to lead Nigeria anywhere but downwards.

""Rather than address serious issues facing the nation and its citizens, Goodluck Jonathan squanders public funds on tribalistic sycophants and thugs calling themselves ex-militants.""

The militia group called on Nigerians to disregard the idle threats and ranting of imaginary militant groups and other hired ""Jonathan praise singers"", adding that ""besides empty talk, they are unable to help Jonathan in any way"".

""In fact, most so called ex-militants are hiding in Abuja or Lagos, not venturing near their villages in the Niger Delta,"" it added.

MEND said that its silence thus far, had been strategic and at the right time, it would reduce Nigerian oil production to zero and ""drive off our land, thieving oil companies"".

It observed that British Petroleum (BP) is prepared to pay $25 billion as compensation for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in the United States, yet for worse spills in the Niger Delta ""our people are paid with death at the hands of the Nigerian military"".

MEND ominously warned that in the dark days to come, MTN, SacOil, and other South African investments would pay a heavy price for the interference of South African President Jacob Zuma in the legitimate fight for justice in the Niger Delta, by its people, blaming the South African president for reducing himself to the position of a hired thug for President Jonathan.

MEND added that it fully understood the negative impact its assault on the Nigerian oil industry would have on the ordinary citizen in a country which relies almost entirely on one source of revenue.

""Unfortunately, the extremely irresponsible, floundering government of Nigeria is more concerned with enriching themselves and family members than attending to the problems of the Niger Delta and the continuously depreciating standard of living of the ordinary Nigerian,"" it said.

It described the Nigerian government as being incapable of managing roads, refineries, power stations and other basic infrastructure, ""which is again squandering valuable public funds on a committee tasked with investigating the viability of nuclear energy for electricity generation"".

""The government of Nigeria is incapable of safely disposing household refuse. How then do they plan to deal with the toxic by-product of nuclear energy?

""Nigerians must know that their ignoramus of a president is controlled by Obasanjo, Western nations, an imbecilic wife and an army of sorcerers,"" it stated.

The militia group said that in this new phase of its struggle for justice, it would pay considerable attention to dealing with security forces and traitorous indigenes of the Niger Delta.

""In this regard, MEND wishes to confirm that our fighters were responsible on the attack at Ogbobagbene in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State, on the compound of Godsday Orubebe, Minister for Niger Delta,"" it said.

It advised the general public to take very seriously, any warnings of impending bombings as such warnings would always precede a bombing, providing sufficient time for evacuation.

""Specific members of the security services and the media will in addition to email, receive notification of an impending attack, by SMS in order to minimise the possibility of civilian casualties,"" MEND stated.

However, MEND's threat to target South African interests in Nigeria has prompted the country's Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation to launch an investigation into the threat.

""It's a matter we'll look into definitely; terrorism has to be rooted out,"" spokesman for the Ministry of International Rela-tions and Cooperation, Clayson Monyela, said by mobile phone yesterday.

""The authorities in Nigeria have always been responsive to acts that are unlawful and will deal with this as they always have dealt with such threats,"" Monyela added.

MTN is leaving security matters to the Nigerian and South African authorities and declined to comment on the threat, a spokesman for the Johannesburg-based company, Rich Mkhondo, said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg.

Last month, the company announced plans to spend more than $1 billion this year to improve its network in Nigeria after the nation's phone regulator demanded better service."

Warri — EX-MILITANTS undergoing training under the Federal Government Amnesty Programme, Monday, bombed a hotel, (name withheld) , Osubi in Okpe local government area of Delta State, which served as their temporal home since last year.

The ex-militants alleged that the consultant was colluding with the management of the hotel to deprive them of their entitlements and shelled the hotel with dynamites.

The hotel management and a source close to the consultant, Generic College, however, described the allegation as unfounded.

It was gathered that the ex-militants were not interested in staying in the hotel or undergoing any training and what they simply wanted was for the consultant to give them money meant for their hotel accommodation and other allowances.

It was gathered that for some months running, it had been a running battle between the consultant and the recalcitrant ex-militants.

Relevant Links Eight Ex-Militants Held Over Hotel Bombing in Delta

When Vanguard visited the hotel, it was discovered that a section of the two-storey building collapsed as a result of the bombing. Several rooms were affected and the debris of the shattered blocks, doors and roof were all over the place.

Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ibrahim Mamman Tsafe, Director of SSS in the state, Area Commanders of Police in Ughelli and Warri visited the scene of the incident, Monday.

The Joint Task Force on the Niger-Delta, Anti-Terrorism Squad and Anti-Bomb Squad were said to have made some arrest as the time of our visit but the details were not available.

An official of the hotel who spoke to Vanguard said he got a report at about 4.00 am on Monday that the hotel was collapsing and rushed down to the hotel, only to find the ex-militants in a ""war"" mood."

Mushin, a Lagos surburb was again engulfed in violence as hoodlums terrorised residents and traders for almost 24 hours unchecked.

Metro learnt that over 20 vehicles were vandalised while three houses were set ablaze during the fracas.

Although it could not be verified as at press time if people were killed in the crisis, it was gathered that over 10 people sustained gunshot wounds.

One of the victims, Sola Godspower, told our correspondent that the hoodlums were from Ereko Street.

He said, “I was on Lawani Street when many thugs came to attack me. I know them to be hoodlums from the area.

“I was stabbed about eight times but was not shot. Also, my house was burnt down by the hoodlums. I don’t know what I did to them?”

It was learnt that the violence paralysed commercial activities in the area as shops were closed.

Our correspondent, who visited the area on Tuesday evening also observed that the incident caused a traffic gridlock as many vehicles tried to avoid being caught in the violence.

It was gathered that the most affected areas were Lawani, Ojelade and Kadiri streets.

An eyewitness, Abiodun Adubi, described the incident as the worst in recent times.

He said, “The guys came wielding sophisticated weapons and terrorised the entire neighbourhood to the extent that schools in the area remained locked and refused to let their pupils go home.

“The hoodlums also seized the opportunity to rob innocent people. One guy known as Raphael, who runs a lottery scheme popularly known as Baba Ijebu, was attacked. His shop was burnt and his generator stolen. A carpenter’s shop was also burnt by the hoodlums.”

The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Joseph Jaiyeoba, told our correspondent on the telephone that many property were vandalised but could not confirm the casualty figure.

“At 8am on Tuesday, three factions of thugs were engaged in a fight. They were throwing bottles but the police immediately waded in. Three kiosks were burnt. As at 2am, the police were still patrolling the area and shooting was still ongoing,” he said.

Meanwhile, a committee of landlords in Mushin has petitioned the state police command commissioner, Mr. Yakubu Alkali, and Governor Babatunde Fashola, over the recurring violence in the area.

Metro learnt that the violence was caused by a struggle for the control of commercial activities in the Jibowu, Fadeyi and Mushin areas of the state.

In the petition titled, ‘Continued breach of peace and wanton destruction of valuable properties by hoodlums,’ the landlords alleged that the violence was being perpetuated by thugs living in Fadeyi area.

The petition was signed by all the landlords on Lawani, Ogidi and Thanni-Olodo streets

It reads in part, “We appeal to you to save our community from persistent attacks from touts, miscreants, thugs and criminals. These criminals have been attacking our community since February 2010 and have succeeded in destroying properties, stealing and looting from people’s shops and houses. They have also inflicted life threatening injuries on people.

“We the entire residents of the community are tired of this insecurity of life and properties and hereby send an ‘SOS’ to you to urgently come to our aid as we can no longer live peacefully in our respective homes.

“Goods and properties stolen and destroyed since the December 3, 2011 are valued at millions of naira. The illicit activities of these criminals are nothing but that of armed robbers.”

The landlords maintained that the case was even more pathetic because policemen who had been sent to quell the violence had been compromised.

“These criminals always hang around Ikorodu Road from Ereko, Ayonuga down to Adewusi Street; they are always aided by riot policemen stationed in those areas mentioned. These policemen are always seen at the forefront and in their midst whenever these criminals come to attack us,” They alleged."

The battle to address the Boko Haram situation continues.

Kaduna was yesterday thrown into confusion and panic when multiple bomb blasts rocked military formations and the flyover bridge at Kawo, leaving the bomber and two others dead. Scores were injured.

LEADERSHIP gathered the first blast occurred at the 1 Divisional Army Headquarters, Kaduna when a suicide bomber in a Siena car was heading towards the administrative block of the army base. It exploded shortly after passing through the security gate successfully on the way to the target point.

The impact of the explosion, according to an eyewitness, shook several buildings at the Army Headquarters and surrounding houses. Two military officers were said to have lost their lives while several others received various degrees of injuries.

Another bomb intended for the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) base exploded at the gate. An eyewitness told LEADERSHIP that the bomb was thrown from a moving vehicle.

According to Squadron Leader Kabiru Ali of the NAF base, ""the bomb exploded outside the perimeter of the Air Force base. We are not going to investigate since we are not directly involved, and the police will carry the investigation.""

The third bomb planted under the flyover of Kawo exploded shattering the screens of moving vehicles, even as scores of passengers were injured. The impact, an according to eyewitness who prefers anonymity, shook the bridge and the road.

""Oga, just some few minutes after we heard a loud sound at the army headquarters, this one under the bridge happened and the whole place was shaking,"" he said.

Other bombs were detonated within and around the army base by a team of police anti-bomb squad. Some arrests were allegedly made.

Official vehicles of the State Emergency Management Agency SEMA, the Red Cross and other agencies were trooping to the scene to carry the victims to hospitals.

Most of the schools surrounding the places were closed down, as parents quickly emerged to take their children home.

Commercial activities were also paralyzed as financial institutions in the state capital immediately shut their gates shortly after the blast. All the major roads have been barricaded with armed soldiers and policemen checking all the vehicles that pass through.

When our correspondents visited the 44 Army Reference Hospital where the victims were taken to, the soldiers prevented them from having access to the victims.

The Boko Haram sect had threatened to attack Kaduna following the arrest of its spokesperson Abul Qaqa last week in Kaduna.

Heavily-armed, stern-looking soldiers barred journalists from getting to the scene of the incident at the Army headquarters, while those who attempted to get close had their cameras seized.

The bomb explosions forced Kawo market, schools, shops and other public places around the area to immediately close, while security men took over the streets, preventing vehicular and human movement that subsequently created heavy traffic and stampede around the Kawo area.

Incidentally, yesterday was the Kawo market day, popularly referred to as 'TALATA' market in Kaduna North local government area. It attracts a large number of buyers and sellers. The market was forced to a close as both buyers and sellers hurriedly packed their belongings and trekked long distances as the roads were immediately blocked by military people.

Hoodlums and miscreants took advantage of the situation and looted shops and items of sellers and buyers at the market. The security men, however, helped to chase them away and brought the situation under control.

A Desmis Independent Television (DITV) camera man Ibrahim Gabia, narrowly escaped death when the bomb under the bridge exploded close to where he was trying to establish a shot of the first bomb that occurred at the 1 Divisional Army Headquarters.

Meanwhile, the soldiers on patrol at the scene of the incident forcefully collected the Cameras of LEADERSHIP reporter, AIT and KSTV reporters who were taking live pictures of the event.

As at the time of filing this report, the Cameras were still in the hands of the soldiers.

NO SOLDIER DIED DURING ATTACK - ARMY

Meanwhile, the Nigeria Army in a statement issued to newsmen entitled 'Failed Suicide Attack on Headquarters, 1 Division, Nigerian Army' by the assistant director, army public relations, Lieutenant Colonel Abubakar Edun, reads:

""At about 12.18pm on Tuesday, 7th February, 2012, a failed suicide bomb attempt was made on the headquarters complex of 1 division Nigerian Army, Kawo, Kaduna.

""The two suicide bombers came in two vehicles, a Siena Toyota space bus and a Honda Accord. The drivers of the two vehicles over ran the security post and the lawn leading to the headquarters complex.

""One of the vehicles (Toyota Siena Space bus) exploded by the car park directly in front of the headquarters when a soldier opened fire on the car after the attacker refused to stop which made him lose control of the vehicle.

""The second vehicle which did not explode (Honda accord) was loaded with 10 numbers of 20 litres of improvised explosive dives (IEds), 4 number of 30 number loaded with IEDS and 2 numbers of large peak containers also loaded with IEDS.

""The suicide bomber in the Siena space bus died in the attempt, while there was no casualty on the part of our own troops.""

NIGERIAN AIR FORCE BASE NOT AFFECTED

But the Nigerian Air Force has said that the bomb blasts in Kaduna did not affect the Nigerian Air Force Base and no casualty was recorded within its premises. In a Statement issued in Abuja yesterday and signed by Air Commodore Yusuf Anas, the Air Force said the incident took place about 500 meters away.

The statement reads in parts, this is to inform the general public that the Nigerian Air Force Base Kaduna was not affected by the bomb blast which occurred at about 1230hrs.

The bomb blast occurred about 500 meters from the Air Force Base outer perimeter fence along Mando Road, Kaduna. No casualty was recorded in the incident.

SECT APPOINTS 4 TO DIALOGUE WITH FG

Meanwhile, the Boko Haram sect has appointed four negotiators to negotiate with the federal government on its behalf.

Those named in a video during the NTA Network News were Sheikh Abubakar Gero, Dr. Shettima Ali Mungono, former Governor of Yobe State, Alhaji Bukar Abba Ibrahim, and Barrister Aisha Alkali Wakil.

The tape which NTA claimed was delivered by an unidentified source, featured two figures, fully masked in black, only the voice of one was heard, while the other was silent

""We here confirm and accept the reported initiative of Mr. President for a dialogue as a welcome development"", the speaker who did not identify himself said.

According to him, the group trusts the named leaders and said ""the decision taken by these people can actually change the whole situation.""

BOKO HARAM SUSPECTS KILLED IN KANO

Fresh facts emanating from the Kano Police Command yesterday indicated that scores of suspected Boko Haram members were killed by the Joint Task Force on Monday night during a renewed clash with the suspected members of the sect in Mariri town.

Mariri, which is about 15 km away from the metropolis, witnessed a long gun battle between the group and the JTF, as renewed fight between the sect members and the police in Sharada led to the destruction of a part of the police outpost.

Residents of Mariri Quarters said that some unspecified number of persons were killed in the area during the encounter when the Joint Task Force raided the area in a measure aimed at unleashing offensive at the house of suspected members of the religious body.

Both the police and the soldiers, however, have denied recording any casualty in the encounter but the state's commissioner of police, Alhaji Ibrahim Idris, has confirmed that some explosives, 10 Ak 47 rifles, 26 magazines, 106 Live ammunition, and seven bags of fertilizer were discovered.

An eyewitness told our correspondent in Kano that the recovered weapons and the explosives were discovered in a grave dug by the suspects.

Army public relations officer Lt. Iweha Ikedichi told journalists that no soldier was killed and denied reports that army patrol vehicles were seen taking dead bodies to Muhammadu Abdullahi Wase Specialist Hospital. Officials of the hospital also refused to comment on the issue when approached.

At the Sharada police station, the gunmen were said to have hurled some explosives immediately they arrived at the area around 6pm leading to the burning of the entire police office. The attack, according to findings, lasted nearly an hour and an eyewitness said he saw three dead bodies in a drainage near the outpost while another witness said he saw an elderly person riding a motorbike who was shot in the head in the area."

Asaba — Violence broke out in Onitsha, Anambra State, yesterday after a policeman shot dead a bus driver who refused to pay a N20 tip, heightening ethnic tensions in the commercial city.

Hoodlums and bus drivers took to the streets protesting the killing of the driver, setting up bonfires along the streets and targeting shops.

The violence soon took an ethnic dimension when some of the rioters targeted northern communities in the city, forcing them to flee to police and military bases in Onitsha and in neighbouring Asaba, Delta State.

Witnesses said trouble started when a coaster bus, which took off from the Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS) Junction along Awka Road, came to a police checkpoint along New Market Road.

At the checkpoint, a policeman demanded N20 tip but driver Edwin refused to give him, according to conductor of the bus Samuel Ekwueme.

""The policeman stopped my Oga at ABS junction demanding for N20 bribe, but he beat the checkpoint. But as we were going down to Ose main market, he noticed that the policeman took a commercial motorcycle and followed us,"" the conductor said.

""And when he (the deceased) noticed that the policeman was following us, he tried to follow the one-way through New Market road but the policeman followed us and shot at the tyre of the vehicle, and we stopped. Then he came to the door and shot Edwin at a close range in the neck,"" he said.

The bus, with registration number AA768AHD, was full with passengers at the time of the incident, and some of the passengers also sustained gunshot injuries, witnesses said.

One of the passengers, Miss Ifeoma Obi, told Daily Trust that when the policeman first shot at the tyres of the vehicle, the driver had to stop because the bus could not move again.

""It was just sheer wickedness on the side of the policeman, who because of just N20, wasted the life of this young man,"" she said.

Residents said wife of the deceased driver gave birth about a week ago.

Shortly after the bus driver was killed, the city erupted in violence as angry bus drivers and mobs trooped out from different locations to protest the killing.

The riot took ethnic coloration as hoodlums in the commercial city went on the rampage, threatening to kill Hausa people because according to them the policeman who shot the driver was a Hausa man.

This forced hundreds of people from the northern communities in the city fleeing to the Central Police Station and other police offices in the city for fear of the mobs. Many others also fled to Asaba.

At the Head Bridge, Onitsha, the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the Fegge police station, Mr. Tafida Saleh, and his men were there to protect the people.

Earlier, a mob booed and threw stones at the police team sent by the Anambra State Police command to appeal to the crowd that erupted after the killing of the bus driver. This forced the policemen to retreat to avoid clashes.

When Acting Police Area Commander of Onitsha, Mr. Rowland Omoteje, accompanied by the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Central Police Station, Mr. Abdul Yusuf, arrived at the scene, the mob pelted them.

In their account of the incident, the police authorities said a mobile police corporal attached to Police Mobile Force PMF 52 on stop-and-search duty tried to stop the deceased and the conductor allegedly tried to disarm the policeman which led to the incident.

A MASSOB official Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka, in his reaction to the incident, advised members of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra not to attack any Hausa man but to dismantle every police checkpoints in the zone.

Ezeonwuka, who is deputy to MASSOB leader Ralph Uwazuruke, said dismantling all police checkpoints was necessary because the security of Ndigbo was not guaranteed even in their land.

""For a Hausa policeman to shoot an Igbo driver here because of mere N20 shows that the policeman is a Boko Haram member but we have urged MASSOB members to leave Hausa people alone because they are not our problem, they should concentrate on dismantling all police checkpoints within the zone,"" he said.

When contacted, the Anambra State Police Commissioner, Mr. Muhtari Ibrahim said the killer cop had been arrested and will undergo orderly room trial and prosecution. He urged the rampaging mobs to calm down and go about with their normal lives.

""I appeal to the rampaging mob to calm down as we are making efforts to settle the matter and bring lasting peace to Onitsha,"" Ibrahim said.

Tension was high in Abraka market in Asaba, populated mainly by northerners, and in other parts of the Delta State capital after the incident.

A number of people who fled into Asaba came with injuries and they took refuge at the B Division of the Nigeria Police in Okwe.

Spokesman for the Delta State police command, DSP Charles Muka, said the command has deployed its men to strategic locations in Asaba to check the situation.

A BBC Hausa reported monitored last night said things had calmed down in Onitsha after troops and riot policemen were deployed."

Gunmen have shot dead two Igbo Christian traders in Potiskum,Yobe state amid a wave of violence blamed on Islamist group Boko Haram. The killing was done yesterday, according to the AFP.

The victims, who were brothers, owned a prominent shop in the city, which has been repeatedly struck by violence blamed on the Islamist sect.

“The two gunmen dressed in white robes arrived at the shop,�? said market trader Kabir Ahmed. “They produced rifles from under their robes and shot the two traders dead.�?

A police source who requested anonymity confirmed the killings and that of a Muslim cleric in the city late Friday.

Security sources have previously told AFP that a group of gunmen linked to Boko Haram has carried out targeted killings in the city in recent weeks.

A church guard in Potiskum was shot dead on January 30 after suspected members of the Islamist group on January 11 killed four Christians in the city who, like Saturday’s victims, were members of the Igbo tribe.

The Igbo ethnic group is overwhelmingly Christian and its members generally originate from the country’s east.

Boko Haram has repeatedly targeted Christians, notably in coordinated attacks on Christmas Day.

The group has also killed Muslim clerics who publicly criticised its extremist tactics, but its recent assaults have primarily been directed at the police and other symbols of authority.

Few analysts see Boko Haram as a cohesive group. It is believed to have a series of factions, including a hardcore Islamist cell.

Boko Haram has killed more than 200 people already this year, according to Human Rights Watch.

The Igbo nationalist group, MASSOB, has urged Igbo traders to leave the North.

The death of the passenger sparked off serious youth vengeance on the Police Station leading to the ransacking of the station and the escape of all detainees.

It took the intervention of soldiers in the Cantonment to ward off the rampaging youths from burning down the station located exactly opposite the Cantonment main gate on the Expressway.

The incident happened in the morning. An eye-witness told Daily Champion that the dead, a heavily built family man was clutching his bible on the passenger's side meaning that he was on his way to church before he was felled by the police bullet.

When Daily Champion arrived at the venue, the embattled bus was still on the spot of the incident with congealed blood of the dead dotting parts of the vehicle and the main road.

Our correspondent gathered further that the soldiers who saved the barracks from being burned down equally arrested the trigger happy corps who is now in their custody.

Another eyewitness said when the Area F Commander arrived, he was crying profusely looking at the hefty but dead man before he ordered that he should be carried to the mortuary.

As at press time, riot policemen had cordoned off the entire vicinity with a standby Armored Personnel Carrier (APC) in front of the embattled Onireke Police Station even as the station remained deserted.

Efforts to get the identity of the deceased failed as nobody could identify him."

Lokoja — SOME armed bandits suspected to be the dreaded Boko Haram sect yesterday stormed the Nigerian Prisons at Koton-Karfe in Kotonkarfe Local Government Area of Kogi State, set free prison inmates and killed one prison warden.

The incident, which occurred at about 7 p.m. took the prison warders by surprise.

The armed bandits were said to have taken the advantage that Muslims were already observing the 'Magrib"" prayers before they unleashed the attack on the prison.

Sources close to the prison area told The Moment that the armed bandits, on arrival at the prison, opened fire on one of the security men at the entrance of the prison and killed him on the spot.

The main gate of the prison was bombed by the Boko Haram sect, said to be numbering over 20.

'Immediately, they moved into the prison and shot sporadically to chase other prison officers away and freed some of inmates said to be their members arrested and brought to the prison,' the source said.

The inmates were said to have quickly massed out of the prisoners and escaped immediately the attack subsided.

The Moment further gathered from one of the prison officers, who would not want to be mentioned in print, that the sect member came in full force as they parked their vehicles very far from the prison and stormed the place on motor bike.

He said residents, who live closed to the prison, ran for their dear lives on hearing gun shots, adding that the operation lasted for about 30 minutes.

The Police Public Relations officer, Mr. Ajayi Akinsanmi, who could not give details of the attack, said he was still awaiting detailed information from the area as he was away in Lagos."

There were strong indications on Tuesday that President Goodluck Jonathan had renewed the appointment of Justice Dalhatu Adamu as the Acting President of the Court of Appeal.

Adamu has served three consecutive three-month terms as the acting PCA head.

A Senate Committee chairman confirmed the development.

The senator said Jonathan’s action was in line with constitutional provisions.

“I can confirm to you that the President has renewed his appointment and there is nothing wrong with that.

“Though Adamu’s tenure as acting President of the court ended on Monday, the President has asked him to remain in office.”

The senator said the President’s action must have been based on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council.

“The law does not require the President to make such appointment in an acting capacity with recourse to the NJC or Senate,” he said.

Section 238(5) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides for a single term of three months in acting capacity as PCA, while also giving the NJC the powers to limitlessly extend the acting tenure.

While there was no formal confirmation of the renewal of the appointment by the President, a source at the Presidency, who craved anonymity, confirmed that Jonathan had renewed Adamu’s appointment."

Gunmen on Wednesday night killed two police officers at a check point near the NNPC Mega station in Minna, Niger state.

Alhaji Ibrahim Maishanu, Niger Commissioner of Police, disclosed this in Minna on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).

He said that the incident took place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., adding, ""it was dark when my men were attacked"".

According to the commissioner of police, a rifle belonging to one of the deceased officer was taken away by the gunmen, while fleeing the scene of the incident.

He said the gunmen beat a hasty retreat to escape the wrath of the other security agents, who went to the area to foil the attack.

Maishanu, who condemned the action of the gunmen, gave the assurance that the command would definitely track down the hoodlums and make them to face the wrath of the law.

NAN recalls that incident came barely a week after some hoodlums killed three police men - an Inspector and a Sergeant in the state capital, and a Corporal at Maje in Suleja Local Government Area of the state.

The Commissioner of Police said that the command on Wednesday recovered an AK47 rifle from a suspect in Lapai Local Government Area of the state, who had escaped during the jail break in Kogi.

Linking the killing of the officers in Minna to the arrest and confiscation of weapons from the Kogi jail break inmates, he said, ""each time we re-arrest the Kogi jail break inmates, our men are attacked"".

He also revealed that the command had arrested some armed robbery suspects in Mariga Local Government Area, adding that two locally made guns were recovered from them.

He said his officers and men would intensify surveillance on criminals and their associates so as to secure the lives and property of citizens across the state.

Kano — Gunmen riding motorbikes yesterday fired shots at the home of acting Inspector General of Police Mohammed Abubakar at the Lawal Dambazau Link Kano, killing two police guards and injuring two others.

The police authorities confirmed that there was a fatal shooting incident around BUK Road area in Kano yesterday but did not say if the IG's home was targeted.

Residents said the shooting incident happened at about 8.30am when gunmen riding motorcycles opened fire at Abubakar's home, killing the policemen.

The shooting caused panic in the area as people feared a repeat of the coordinated bomb and gun attacks on January 20 in the city, which claimed at least 185 lives and for which Boko Haram claimed responsibility.

When our reporter attempted to visit the area yesterday, soldiers had blocked all the roads leading to Abubakar's house and diverted traffic.

Spokesman for the Kano police command ASP Musa Magaji Majiya said the gunmen opened fire ""along BUK Road by Island, after Gidan Murtala"", and two policemen on ""foot patrol"" were killed while two others were injured.

Majiya did not disclose the identity of the affected policemen. He said the ""area was thoroughly combed and 15 suspects were arrested while investigation was on.""

The injured policemen were being treated at a hospital, he added.

A spokeswoman for the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Hajiya Hawwa Abdullahi, confirmed that two dead bodies of policemen were brought to the hospital's mortuary.

Acting IG Abubakar was in Abuja at the time of yesterday's attack on his Kano home, but it was not known if any of his family members were at the residence during the incident.

The attack on Abubakar's home came a day after soldiers raided a suspected hideout of Boko Haram in Kano, arresting four people.

Clashes between gunmen and security forces have flared several times in Kano since the January 20 attack, which is the deadliest yet claimed by Boko Haram during its two-year-old insurgency.

During that attack, at least eight security formations as well as home of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 1 were attacked. The AIG's family escaped with injuries."

... kill two, injure one in Kaduna

By Luka Binniyat

KADUNA- Unknown gunmen, Sunday night, raided some communities in Kaura Local Govern-ment Area of Kaduna State, killing two men and leaving a woman critically injured, Chairman of the local government, Mrs Florence Aya, told reporters on telephone, yesterday.

This brings the number of those killed in the area since last December to eight.

Kaduna State Police Spokesman, Assistant Superintendent, Aminu Lawan, could not be reached for his comments on the matter as he neither picked his calls nor responded to SMS sent to him on the incident.

Meanwhile, Governor Patrick Yakowa has condemned the attacks, saying they were contrary to his peace initiative for the state.

Mrs. Aya said: ""Around 11pm yesterday (Sunday), some people with guns came and simultaneously attacked Kukum Gida and Gidan Waya.

""The attack occurred just near the palace of the traditional ruler of Kagoro. They opened fire on some unsuspecting residents. They killed two youths and fled.

""At Gidan Waya village, one woman was severely injured. Her condition is very critical. We are thinking of moving her away from the Kafanchan General Hospital to another place.

""The incidents made youths and women in Kagoro to take to the streets in protest. They came out in large numbers demanding that the soldiers deployed to maintain law and order must do their work. They also called for peace and end to the violence.""

A statement, yesterday, by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Media and Publicity, Mr. Reuben Buhari read: ""The Governor of Kaduna State, Sir Patrick Yakowa, has observed with concern the recent spate of attacks on communities and innocent citizens in some parts of the state, with intent to disrupt the peace currently being enjoyed.

""Governor Yakowa totally condemns such killings under whatever guise or motive and describes such as unnecessary, unwarranted and unfortunate."""

Jos — Two suicide bombers in a Golf car, yesterday, crashed into the headquarters of the Church of Christ in Nigeria, COCIN, in the Plateau State leaving at least five people dead and about 40 people injured.

At least five others, most of them commercial motorcyclists were said to have been killed in reprisal attacks by irate youths in different parts of the city. Some shops around Bank Road were also torched by protesting youths.

Divine intervention saved what could have resulted in several deaths as the car laden with improvised explosive devices including industrial and refrigerator gas cylinders exploded just metres away from the church building.

A motorcycle was said to have blocked the way and the car exploded as the suicide bomber tried to overrun it into the church building. About 30 cars within the premises were damaged while glasses of buildings around 500 metres radius of the church were smashed.

The suicide bomber was blown into smithereens while the car was also mangled beyond recognition with only the engine identifiable. His accomplice who jumped out of the car before the explosion was lynched as he tried to escape after the blast.

The blast which occurred at about 7.25 a.m while the first service was already on, shook most parts of the state capital with residents in far-flung parts attesting to feeling the vibration in their homes.

A security officer of the church who narrated the incident said the car forced its way into the church premises and sped towards the church before crashing into the motorcycle which stopped it from getting into the church building.

Irate church members pounced on a soldier alleged to have flagged the vehicle into the premises without proper check and would have lynched him but for the intervention of some church leaders. The soldier was later taken away ostensibly for interrogation.

Governor Jonah Jang who visited the church premises and some of the injured at the Plateau Specialist Hospital condemned the incident coming when efforts were on to consolidate on the return of peace to the state.

He directed security agencies to beef up security at churches and mosques to prevent any further attack adding that no effort would be spared to sustain the peace in the state.

The governor who was accompanied by the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Dipo Ayeni, Commandant of the Civil Defence Corps, Mr. Desmond Agu and the Minister of Water Resources, Mrs. Sarah Ochekpe appealed to the people not to take the laws into their hands but to allow security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of evil.

Reacting to the incident Executive Director of Centre for the Advocacy of Justice and Rights, Mr. Gad Peter, condemned the bombing describing it as ""clear indication that the security of the state is under a new threat and all citizens must be alert.""

He urged the new commander of the Special Task Force in the state to ""ensure that the peace Jos enjoyed in the last few months under the control of his predecessor is sustained.""

Meanwhile, the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, said in a statement that three people were killed in the blast while 38 were hospitalized. A statement by NEMA spokesman, Yushau Shuaib said the organization and the Red Cross had completed evacuation of victims at the scene.

Boko Haram claims responsibility

Boko Haram Islamic sect, yesterday, said it was behind the suicide bomb attack outside the church in Jos, and warned of more such assaults.

Its spokesman, Abul Qaqa, told reporters in a conference call: ""We carried out the attack on COCIN church in Jos today and we did what we did as part of our resolve to avenge the killings and dehumanisation of Muslims in Jos in the last 10 years.""

President Jonathan condemns violence

President Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, condemned the suicide bombing at COCIN in Jos and the mindless acts of reprisal that followed the incident. He said in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Dr. Reuben Abati, that those who sought to divide the nation by fear and terror, would not succeed.

The president said: ""The indiscriminate bombing of Christians and Muslims is a threat to all peace-loving Nigerians. Mr. President will continue to stand firm to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians while ensuring that the relevant institutions move against those who disregard the sanctity of life in the pursuit of sectarian ambitions.""

He said that government was ""gradually and firmly bringing justice to those behind the attacks and exposing their identities and dismantling their terror infrastructure,"" adding that ""those behind similar acts of terror in recent times have been arrested and are being investigated with a view to prosecuting them accordingly as a deterrent to others.""

FG still open for dialogue - Maku

Mr Labaran Maku, Minister of Information, said the government was still open to dialogue with members of the Boko Haram sect.

Maku who said this at a Security Conference organised by UK-based BEN Television in London, noted: ""We are ready to talk to them but we need to have a platform for that to happen. We will continue to maintain the pressure. Even in Afghanistan, the Americans are talking to the Taliban.""

Maku, who said it was untrue that the government did not have a strategy in place to fight terrorism, added: ""in the midst of war you must develop a strategy. We currently have a West African strategy where all our security chiefs across the region are meeting regularly to discuss cross-boundary problems, including terrorism. We have a strong national resource and capacity to tackle this menace and are open to fresh ideas on this menace.""

He said that some members of the group were willing to talk to the gov ernment, adding that it was no longer a unified organisation. ""This is a war of minds; it's not just a military or security war; how to talk to them is a long drawn process. We need to know who they are.""

Also, Hon Abike Dabiri-Erewa , Chairman House Committee on Diaspora, said that Boko Haram was neither a religious nor ethnic group. She said: ""It is a social, economic and political issue and some people just want to use it to destabilise the political process."" The lawmaker, who commended the government for its efforts at tackling the menace, however, said more needed to be done.

Boko Haram activities getting out of hand—CAN

National President of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor said the Boko Haram sect was getting out of hand and unless the government demonstrates the political will to deal decisively with the trend Nigeria will soon overtake the rest of the world as a terrorist nation.

Oritsejafor said: ""Why will such individuals not be shown the way out of the civil service and prosecuted for the great disservice they have done to the country that pays their bill?"" Pastor Oritsejafor, in a telephone interview said the war against terror should go beyond the change of guards at the Police Force, and should be extended to the prosecution of all those fingered as sponsors of the Boko Haram sect.

He said: ""For far too long, we have pretended that all is well with this project Nigeria, even when it is obvious that we are deceiving ourselves.""

In his reaction, renowned televangelist, Rev Uma Ukpai, warned members of the Islamic militant group, to stop further violent attacks or risk another civil conflagration which will not be in the interest of anyone.

Addressing select media partners in Lagos, Rev Ukpai said: ""They will not succeed. Boko Haram cannot divide the country. Remember, they don't have the monopoly of violence.

Their current campaign can only push us to the wall and if they push us to the wall, we will have no choice than to fight back and it would be devastating because they are fighting with anger, but ours will be prosecuted with calculated precision."""

Suspected gunmen on Tuesday struck in Adamawa State, targeting police stations and killing one policeman in the process.

The killing of the policeman however came on a day residents of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital had to scamper for safety as gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram engaged soldiers of the Joint Military Task Force (JTF) in a gun duel which lasted for over half an hour.

The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Altine Daniel (ASP), who confirmed the incident, said one of the attackers was equally shot dead.

According to the PPRO, “At about 17:20 hour on Tuesday, some unidentified gunmen attacked the Demsa Divisional Police Station, killing one of our men, identified as CPL Lukman Ahbdullahi, and carting away the A.K47 rifle of the deceased.”

He added that his officers returned fire for fire and one of the attackers was killed, while the quick response of the people of the town to the distress call of the police sent the attackers fleeing.

Daniel said though no arrest had been made, a team of crack detectives were now combing the area to fish out the criminals.

However, the exchange of gunfire in Maiduguri, followed a bomb thrown at a kiosk in the Abaganaram ward of Maiduguri metropolis by the sect.

The blast which happened around 7.30a.m. gave a deafening sound which ended up sending many residents scampering for safety. It was learnt that one of the soldiers who engaged the sect in a shootout was injured.

The injured soldier was later rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) by the JTF patrol vehicle and admitted at the Accident and Emergency (A and E) and Intensive Care Units (ICU) of the hospital at 9.35am, It was also gathered that five vehicles and six tricycles were also destroyed in the blast.

Confirming the blasts in Maiduguri, spokesman of JTF, Lt.Col Hassan Mohammed, in a signed statement said: “At about 7.30a.m. this morning (yesterday) around the Customs Bridge area of Maiduguri, gunmen suspected to be members of Boko Haram detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in a kiosk. The explosion destroyed some cars in the area. However, no life was lost in the incident.”

The statement reads in part: “members of the public are also advised to report any threat to public property to security agents,” adding: “Some group of hoodlums claiming to be members of the sect have engaged in the destruction of public property as two schools have been burnt within the metropolis in few days.”

Meanwhile, an Improvised Explosive was yesterday detonated by the anti bomb squad of the Nigerian Police Force at the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida market in Suleja yesterday.

According to our source, the explosive was dropped in a polythene bag in the market before it was discovered and detonated by men of the anti bomb squad at about the time traders started coming to the market.



When contacted, the state police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) ASP Richard Oguche, said it was not true adding that nothing like that happened in the state.



It was also learnt that the four affected torched schools include, Abagannaram, Budum, and Gomari Costain Primary Schools, destroying 31 classrooms, and two stores within two weeks.



The JTF spokesman emphasised that security is a collective responsibility of the residents and they should fully cooperate with security agencies to achieve a lasting peace in the state."

Suspected Boko Haram sect members.

Maiduguri — Gunmen yesterday detonated a powerful explosive at a primary school in Maiduguri, causing a fire that razed classrooms and the headmaster's office.

The dawn attack on Gomari Costain Primary School was the fourth such raid suspected to be launched by Boko Haram over the past week, forcing four primary schools in the city to shut down.

The three other primary schools earlier burnt and shut down were those in Kulagumna, Budum and Abbaganaram.

At least 5,000 school children have been forced to stay at home because of the incidents, according to estimates by teachers in the affected schools.

Each of the four attacks was staged at night when the schools were closed, and so no pupil or teacher was killed.

In yesterday's attack at Gomari, resident Sani Salisu said he heard a ""deafening and frightening sound"" around 5.45am, shortly after the morning Muslim prayers.

""There is dusk-to-dawn curfew in Maiduguri and therefore must of us did not go to the mosque for the morning prayers. The sound of the blast was followed by gunshots. It was in the morning that we realized that the blast was at the primary school,"" Salisu said.

The New Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that some teachers of the school said a group of persons, mainly teenagers, drove away the security guard before setting the school ablaze.

One of the teachers, who lives near the school premises, said, ""We heard a loud noise in the school at night and we thought it was a minor thing but when we reported for duty in the morning we discovered that fire had burnt the school. When we asked the security guard on duty he told us what happened.""

Another resident who did not want his name in print said he saw the dead body of an unidentified man around 7am yesterday near the blast scene.

""The copse was lying on ground about 200 metres away from the scene of the blast. I also saw another man with gunshot injuries being taken away,"" he said.

Spokesman for the Borno State police command Samuel Tizhe confirmed that there was an attack at a primary school in the early hours of yesterday.

""We are, however, investigating circumstances that prompted the attacks on primary schools. Most of the schools affected by the assault were renovated recently,"" he said.

Boko Haram, whose name means 'Western education is prohibited', has targeted mainly security formations since they launched their campaign of violence nearly two years ago.

In the attack on Kulagumna Primary School 10 days ago, two blocks of classrooms and the headmaster's office were destroyed.

At Abbaganaram school, 20 classes, five offices and some stores where destroyed, while at Budum, four classrooms and a store filled with books and instructional materials were destroyed.

The new trend of attacks on primary schools has forced many parents to withdraw their children and wards from schools for fear of their safety, teacher Fanta Kaka Modu told Daily Trust.

""For now, at least 5,000 pupils in the four primary schools that have been burnt down must remain at home,"" she said.

But officials of the State Universal Primary Education Board (SUBEB) are yet to give details of the impact of the attacks.

No one claimed responsibility for yesterday's strike, but Boko Haram said they executed the earlier attack on the three primary schools.

In a teleconference with journalists in Maiduguri on Sunday, Boko Haram spokesman Abul Qaqa said the sect attacked the three schools because security men had been raiding Islamic schools in Maiduguri recently.

""We attacked the schools because security operatives are going to Islamiyya schools and picking teachers. We are attacking the public schools at night because we don't want to kill innocent pupils. Unless (Islamic schools) teachers are allowed to be, we would be compelled to continue attacking schools,"" Qaqa said."

Yenagoa — At least eight security operatives including four soldiers and four marine policemen were on Thursday confirmed killed by suspected gunmen along Nembe, Brass and Ogbia waterways in Bayelsa State.

Among the killed suspected soldiers include a serving Lieutenant Colonel and three others whose identities are not made public as at the time of this report.

The gunmen suspected to be sea pirates laid ambush and opened fire on the boat that was conveying the four soldiers, while at Nembe, suspected sea pirates fired at marine policemen in a checking point killing four officers whose names are still sketchy.

The gunmen, Daily Champion gathered, attacked the soldiers and the marine policemen in three speed boats and shot sporadically killing the security officers, even as the police authority in Yenagoa have confirmed recovering the corpse of four policemen whose identities are unknown.

The killings of the soldiers and the policemen took place in separate locations within the Nembe, Brass and Ogbia waterways.

Sources close to our correspondent confirmed that two soldiers died immediately while others were on danger lists and later died on their way for treatment.

Our correspondent who visited the police command to confirm the deaths of the gallant marine police officers reports that the officers and men of the command were on mourning mood as efforts to speak with the Commissioner of Police, Christian Olakpe proved abortive while others ranks and files were seen having ear to ear discussion on the sad killings.

Confirming the killing of the marine policemen, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Emakpae Egwuvoen ASP said the corpses of four deceased policemen have been recovered as the command is still waiting for more details on the sad incident.

Emakpae also said the detachment of Soldiers from the JTF have been deployed to the waterways to comb for the killers of the policemen and the Soldiers.

In his reaction, media coordinator, Joint Military Taskforce (JTF) Lt Col Timothy Antigha said the attack was suspected to have been carried out by gunmen.

One person was feared dead and 40 vehicles vandalised on Sunday as hoodlums went on the rampage in Ebute-Meta area of Lagos.

PUNCH Metro learnt that two tricyles and seven shops were also vandalised during the violence when some youths suspected to be supporters of Mr. Alao Owolabi, a member of the House of Representatives, representing the Lagos Mainland Constituency, clashed with some hoodlums in the area.

An eyewitness, who craved anonymity, said the lawmaker’s supporters besieged the area to avenge the harassment meted out to him by some hoodlums on Saturday.

He said, “Yesterday (Saturday), when he (Owolabi) was driving home, some youths hailed and wanted him to give them some money. But he declined and the youth banged his car in annoyance. So, the lawmaker brought in some policemen and identified the man who banged his car. However, the youth did not allow the policemen to take the man away and this resulted in a fight. During the fight, the lawmaker’s cloth was torn.

“When the violence escalated, a policeman shot one person in the hand. Later, the policemen reinforced and started shooting. This morning (Sunday), we just saw some area boys from Otto who besieged our neighbourhood. They started shooting and destroying shops. They also took away telephones and money from traders.

“On their way back, they met a policeman in mufti coming from a church and wanted to rob him. But the policeman resisted and they shot him. He also brought a gun and shot in the air to escape. In the ensuing confusion, one person was killed.”

Mr. Adenowo Raji, whose car was also damaged, said the police had assured him that those who suffered losses would be compensated.

Raji said, “The incident was a spill over of what happened on Saturday night. Some youths at a social event harassed the lawmaker on his way home and I think some of his sympathisers came to avenge what the youth did to him.

“But unfortunately, they went on the rampage and started destroying property of innocent people. It is very pathetic that this could happen in a broad day light. The police have advised that we should record the destruction with a video camera and also take pictures.”

Another victim, Mr. Lukman Balogun, said those who suffered losses should be compensated.

“I am sure more than 40 cars were damaged. We want everything to be replaced. It is an insult to the community,” Balogun said.

Another victim, who identified herself simply as Mrs. Sherifat, said goods in her shop at 19, Herbert Macaulay Street were stolen by the hoodlums.

An electronics dealer, who identified himself simply as Dauda, said, “The hoodlums came to meet me and insisted that I should give them money. When I refused, they brought out gun and another attacked me with a cutlass. They took the N25,000 with me; damaged my car and goods worth N200, 000.”

A trader at the scene, who was also affected, Ngozi Onyeachi, said all she depended on had been stolen by the hoodlums.

She said, “They destroyed all my drinks and took away the N62,000 I collected from my monthly contributions. The police should ensure that my money is returned.”

Efforts to speak with the lawmaker proved abortive as policemen guiding his residence turned our correspondent back.

When contacted on the telephone, the spokesman for the state police, Mr. Joseph Jaiyeoba, said he could not reach the Divisional Police Officer, Denton Police Division, under whose jurisdiction the violence occurred, to confirm the incident."

One of the 60 houses razed in the mayhem.

SIXTY SIX lives were lost Monday in separate incidents in Benue, Plateau and Osun throwing several families into mourning.

No fewer than 45 persons are feared dead in a renewed skirmish between Fulani herdsmen and native Tiv community in Gwer West local government area of Benue State while 14 people were burnt to death with 12 others seriously injured in an auto-accident that occurred at Iwaraja junction, near Ilesa, Osun state.

Also, 7 persons were crushed to death in another accident involving a trailer and a commercial Peugeot car along the Jos-Bukuru express highway.

Bloodbath in Benue

The bloodbath in Benue has left women and children seeking refuge in bushes and forests in the local government area.

The President of Tyosin Youth Association, Engr. Joseph Mom who disclosed this yesterday while briefing journalists in Makurdi said the invaders stormed the area early Sunday morning killing people and burning down houses and properties in the area.

Mom said the Fulani herdsmen came from areas bordering the local government with the River Benue to carry out the attack on the affected communities of Tse-Ayande, Chille, Mma-Kpe, Tse-Gboku, Tse-Kpar and several other areas

He lamented that the where about of most inhabitants of affected communities are still unknown.

According to him, ""They usually cross from the River with speed boat to carry out this premeditated attack. We have been hospitable to the Fulanis but they have continued to attack us on issues bothering on grazing areas"".

He added,""They are usually heavily armed living us always on the defensive. May be they felt what happened last year was not enough so they have come back to continue from where they stopped"", Mom lamented.

The Youth president lambasted security agencies accusing them of not living up to expectation in checking Fulani incessant invasion of the area, contending that the herdsmen have continued with the actbof hostility without being arrested.

He therefore called on the Federal government to as a matter of urgency deploy a special security task force to protect and guarantee the safety of the people who now live in panic

Meanwhile, the State Police Public Relations' Officer ASP Ejike Alaribe confirmed in a telephone interview that the Police could confirm only 16 Deaths.

Alaribe intimated that security operatives have been deployed to the area to forestall further bloodbath.

7 crushed to death in Jos

In Jos, the driver of the trailer with registration number XA 847 was said to have lost control while answering a phone call, crossing to the other lane of the express road where it crashed into the Peugeot 504 car with registration number AH 762 KUJ believed to have taken off from Mangu.

The commercial vehicle was said to be dropping passengers when the trailer rammed into it and another car which had four occupants. One of those injured and rushed to hospital was a pregnant woman.

Angry youths said to have been angered by alleged lack of remorse of the driver torched the trailer and it took the intervention of the police and other security agencies to bring the situation under control.

The bodies of those killed were later deposited at the Plateau Specialist Hospital where some of the injured were also taken for treatment by men of the Federal Safety Corps and the police.

14 die in Osun accident

The FRSC Sector Commander in Osun, Mr Sunday Maku, who confirmed the casualty figures in the accident that happened in the state said the victims, including two drivers, were burnt beyond recognition when two buses coming from opposite directions collided and caught fire.

He said one of the buses was coming from Akure and heading to Ibadan while the other was moving in the opposite direction.

""The two buses were a white Toyota Hiace Bus with registration number LG 27 GAR with the inscription, Akoko Edo Line, while the other was a Volkswagen wagon with white and orange colour and an unidentified registration number.

""Twelve adults, including eight males and four females who were seriously injured, were rushed to Wesley College Hospital in Ilesa for treatment,"" he said.

He blamed the incident, which occurred at about 12:10 p.m., on over speeding and dangerous overtaking."

It was a day of rage in the Rivers State Command of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). A corporal broke a tradition. The tradition of taking what the superior offers without questions. There was a little gift, not bribe or highway collections from motorists.



A gift. A customer who came to a generator-selling company at Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, had dashed the policemen guarding the company some money. After the policemen had greeted the customer with such clichés like your boys are loyal, Öga we are here-o, shun sir (with straightened arms) etc.



When the customer left, the policemen -- three in all -- had to share the cash gift among themselves. As it is, the inspector, being the most senior of the team, had to do the sharing.



But after the sharing, the corporal, name withheld, not only grumbled quietly, he complained about the sharing formula used by the inspector. In his opinion, the sharing ratio was unfair and undermined his share greatly. In his protest, he threatened to reject his share if the inspector did not review the sharing formula.



The latter refused, insisting that he was showing acts of insubordination for a corporal to be questioning the judgement of an inspector. Soon after, a push came to a shove. And an argument ensued. The altercations began to attract the attention of passers-by and those nearby. As the argument increased, their voices also got louder and louder. Tension began to build up. Efforts by some to intervene only worsened the tempo of the brewing feud.



In no time, the anger of the corporal boiled over. He removed his AK 47 rifle which had hung on his right shoulder all the while. Nobody expected what followed next. Not even the inspector. The only thing that confirmed the unexpected was when the gun roared and a hot bullet flew out of it, hitting, thankfully, the inspector on his legs. The corporal aimed at the legs, perhaps to just disable him. The gunshot changed the atmosphere, as many bystanders fled the scene, for their dear lives.



Still raging with seething anger, the corporal drank in the implication of his lethal anger. But he would rather not give anybody any opportunity to be mocked, harassed, questioned or arraigned, not sure whether his victim would survive or die from the gunshot.



He chose to take the lead. To die before any other harm will come to him. He raised the gun again, pointed the nuzzle at his chest, and as many shouted hei, hei, hei, he pulled the trigger, and the hot bullet obediently rushed out, hitting the corporal right at the middle of his chest. He fell. The gun also fell. But for a while, nobody drew near. Everybody, it seemed had his/her heart in his or her mouth.



Everybody stood transfixed, wondering how a little gift could draw such hot blood.



They were rushed to the Teme Hospital run by the Medicine Sans Frontieres (MSF) at Mile One in the town. Police authorities who sent text messages to journalists on the incident said the corporal refused medical treatment. He was said to have fought medical personnel who wanted to treat him. Left to his deadly wish, the corporal soon bled to death, right there in the hospital.



Commenting on the incident, the states police spokesperson, Ben Ugwuegbulem, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), said the corporal, whom he described as a Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) committed suicide.



Ugwuegbulem wrote in a text message to journalists that: At about 09:00 hours a police corporal attached to B Operations department while on duty at Plot 278 Plantgeria Coy, Trans Amadi Industrial Layout, Port Harcourt, shot and wounded on the leg an Inspector of Police working with him in the same beat.



The spokesperson said that there was no history of acrimony or animosity between the duo before the incident.



As at last night, THISDAY gathered that the shot inspector was responding to treatment. But determined to unravel the full details of the unfortunate incident, the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has commenced investigation into the incident.



Meanwhile, the AK47 rifle used by the NCO to commit the crime has been recovered.



The state command which still appeared in shock over the incident said, last night, that it would release the identity of those persons involved in the show of shame.



Efforts to trace the home and background of the dead corporal was unsuccessful as his identity remained shielded by the police authorities, his body had been deposited at the morgue as at last night.

367,Protest as soldiers kill mentally ill man in Rivers,3/8/2012,Alesa,Eleme,Rivers,1,,State Actor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,Gun,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/protest-as-soldiers-kill-mentally-ill-man-in-rivers/,http://allafrica.com/stories/201203091175.html,,,,"Eleme, Rivers, Nigeria",Nigeria,"by Chukwudi Akasike

There was commotion in Alesa community in Eleme Local Government Area of Rivers State on Thursday when two soldiers shot and killed a man, who was alleged to be mentally unstable.

It was learnt that the man, who always stood by the roadside to pelt vehicles with stones and other hard objects, threw a bottle at a Hilux van conveying the soldiers from Refinery Junction to their duty post.

An eyewitness told SATURDAY PUNCH that the soldiers, who were not aware of the mental state and health condition of the young man, took offence as a result of the victim’s action.

According to the eyewitness, the soldiers threatened to shoot the man, a development that spurred the victim to throw a stone at them.

Angered by the development, one of the security operatives was said to have come down from the vehicle and shot the man in the leg before he (victim) fell on the ground.

The eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, said that another soldier came down and shot the man in the chest, killing him instantly.

He said, “This man was always smashing the windscreens or side mirrors of private vehicles. People in Eleme knew him for that, but it is unfortunate he did what he did to the wrong people. The soldiers too thought he was a violent person.”

The incident, which happened at about 10 am, made angry youths from the community to storm the streets in protest of the killing of the young man.

It was gathered that the Chairman of Eleme Local Government Area, Chief Oji Ngofa, later appealed to the protesting youths to calm down.

“It is unfortunate that this kind of crude action is still being experienced in a democracy. Why will they (soldiers) just kill a man like that? I am calling for the immediate withdrawal of the soldiers from Eleme.

“Now, they have killed him just like that. We as a council will not take this lightly. We must move for the prosecution of these soldiers, because we know them,” Ngofa added.

While efforts made to contact the Army Public Relations Officer, Lt.-Col. Aminu Iliyasu, to speak on the incident did not yield any result, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ben Ugwuegbulam, confirmed the incident.

Ugwuegbulam, however, said he was yet to get the details of the incident."

Ten people were on Sunday lynched by mobs in parts of the city following a bomb blast at the St. Finbarr's Catholic Church which also killed seven people.

The stampede, our correspondent gathered, started from Nasarawa Gwom area where youths came out in large number to protest the killing of mostly commercial motorcyclists popularly known as Okada riders who were attacked at different areas in Jos.

""But security had to fire gunshots to disperse the youths who all seemed angry over the killing of the innocent Okada riders and some water vendors"", Garba Suleiman, a trader in Nasarawa told our correspondent.

""I was taking my bath when I heard gunshots and when I enquired; I was told that the youths were protesting the killing of some Muslims following the bomb blast at Rayfield."" Maryam Idris, another resident of Nasarawa told our correspondent.

When contacted, the Plateau State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Samuel Dabai, said he was not aware of the stampeded, saying ""I have not been to the office today because I am sick.""

The stampede started in the early hours of yesterday. Our correspondent gathered that the protesting youth claimed that more people were still missing following the reprisal attack.

Special Task Force (STF) spokesperson Captain Markus Mdahyelya, who spoke on phone, said he will call this reporter back but did not up to the time of filing this report.

Further investigation revealed that the impact of the protest rippled through some parts of Jos where it caused stampede in other areas of the city.

Our correspondent, who went round some of the areas saw a large number of security personnel on the alert as many traders were seen closing their shops.

Many parents also were said to have picked their wards from schools for fear of what might follow as confirmed by Malama Rukayya Isa, a mother of two who also picked her children from their school.

Business activities were temporarily interrupted in areas of Terminus Market, Ahmadu Bello Way, British America Junction and Murtala Muhammad Way.

As at the time of filing this report, normalcy has returned to the city but security operatives were on alert to quell any uprising."

Those who lost their lives in the attack were seven Tiv, a retired army officer, Ajohol Adoonkor and an indigene of Plateau State whose identity was yet to be ascertained as at the time of filing this report.

Investigation by the Nigerian Tribune revealed that when the villagers learnt that an attack was imminent on the fateful day, they reported to the police, who allegedly dismissed it with a wave of the hand.

It was further learnt that during the attack, the police at Kadarko Divisional Police Station were again informed but they said they had already sent a signal to the state headquarters and that they would not go to the trouble spot until they got “orders from above.”

But the PPRO of the state police command said the information was not true, quering: “Why would the police, who are supposed to protect life and property say they are waiting for orders from headquarters, so they can't go to the troubled area?”

He continued: “It is not done anywhere. These people were coming from the bush and were caught unawares by the criminals who were shooting sporadically. It was after the incident that they called the police. The police mobilised and moved to the area and when they reached the scene, they discovered that the crime had been committed while the perpetrators had ran away.”"

JTF kills 21-year-old student in Kano

A 21-year-old student, daughter of Alhaji Lawan Mohammad Taura, was one of the two people shot dead Sunday night by members of the Joint Task Force on the outskirts of Kano metropolis. The incident took place around 7.30pm at a roundabout near Sani Abacha Youth Development Centre, Kumbotso local government area.

Although spokesman of the JTF Lt Iweha said the killing was unintentional and was caused by a stray bullet when soldiers were attempting to gun down suspected members of Boko Haram, an eyewitness told our correspondent that the deceased lost her life when the JTF member opened fire on vehicles stopped at a checkpoint; the deceased was inside one of the vehicles attacked by the soldiers.

According to the eye witness, a taxi driver was stopped at the checkpoint and one of the JTF members suspected a bag one of the passengers was carrying and said he wanted to thoroughly search the content. When the passenger attempted to disappear from the area, the soldier was said to have opened fire and the late Aisha was shot in the stomach. She was inside the vehicle along with her mother, her elder brother Abba who was driving the car, and her father, Mohammad, a director of personnel management in Miga local government Area of Jigawa State.

Meanwhile, two gunmen suspected to be members of the Boko Haram sect, who were arrested by members of Sheka community on the outskirts of Kano, were also killed in a crossfire with members of the JTF for alleged armed robbery. The suspects were killed, according to an eyewitness, after engaging members of the JTF in a gun duel.

The JTF public relation officer, Lt. Col. Ikdichi Iweha, said that they were killed by a group of sect members who besieged the area in an attempt to save their own.

According to him, the two alleged armed robbers were arrested by the people of Sheka, and, in an attempt to hand them over to the police, they were confronted by gunmen who then killed the arrested gunmen.

He however denied that six people were killed by soldiers at Sabu Abacha Youth Centre."

No fewer than five persons were reportedly killed by soldiers attached to the Special Task Force at the annual hunting festival of Bassa people in Bassa Local Government Area of Jos, Plateau State on Sunday.

Some youths, who were on a hunting expedition, were said to have engaged in a fight that threatened the continuation of the festival.

Some of the elders of the community were said to have invited policemen at a nearby station who arrested two of the warring youths.

Incensed by the arrests, their colleagues were said to have stormed the police station and released them and followed up by burning the police station and a magistrate’s court adjacent to the police station. They also allegedly vandalised some vehicles and other personal belongings of the policemen at the station.

The police, who were overwhelmed by the rampaging youths, were said have sent a distress call for reinforcement from the STF.

On arrival, the youth were said to have engaged the soldiers, throwing stones and other weapons at them.

The soldiers allegedly opened fire on the attackers, killing five of them instantly.

The killings forced a reaction from the community as women trooped out in large numbers in black attire on Monday to protest against the incident.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Samuel Dabai, who confirmed the development to our correspondent on Monday, said the incident started as a minor fracas between two youths returning from a hunting expedition.

He also confirmed the burning of a police station and magistrate’s court in the community by the rioters.

The PPRO however said only one person died while two others were injured in the incident."

The incident, which saw the robbers severely wounding two policemen, carting away AK47 riffles from the police station's armoury and releasing suspects in the station's custody, came barely 24 hours after four policemen were killed by armed robbers in the state.

Amichi is the home town of the former Chairman of Police Service Commission (PSC), Chief Simon Okeke.

According to sources, the dare-devil robbers who struck at about 2.30am, opened fire on the police station, wounding two policemen on duty, while others ran away for safety. The police station and the vehicles parked at the station, were riddled with bullets.

The source said the assailants had a field day ransacking the deserted police station after they had released the suspects in the police cell and broke into the armoury.

""The heavy sound of gun shots woke the entire neighbourhood and the shooting lasted for about two hours before they drove away without resistance"", the source said.

But another police source, who pleaded anonymity, told Daily Champion that the robbers had been targetting police stations to refill their supply of weapons, adding that the same gang was responsible for the killing of five policemen just 24 hours before this incident.

The source, however, assured that the police were on the trail of the robbers and will soon apprehend them. ""They won't escape. The police have enough information that would lead to their arrest"", the source assured.

Efforts to reach the Anambra State Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), Emeka Chukwuemeka, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), and the Nnewi Area Police Commander, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) John Nwele, for comments failed as their cell phones were ringing without response.

Following the incident, security has been beefed up in police stations around Onitsha and environs, apparently to ward off such attacks.

When Daily Champion reporter visited some police stations in the commercial city, there were heavy presence of security men, comprising the Army and Navy around the stations."

FACTS have emerged, following the killing of eleven people at the Maiduguri Monday Market, by unknown gunmen who stormed the market at about 2:00 pm on Wednesday, April 4, killing nine Igbos and three Kanuris.

According to an eyewitness who spoke during the visit by the Borno State deputy governor, Alhaji Zannah Mustapha when he went round the market during a confidence-building visit on Thursday, the gunmen were over 10 and were young men aged between 16 and 24 years.

He told the deputy governor that they came and took position at the gate, armed with four AK47 rifles while the others were holding pistols. “I am a worker here and I saw them. I saw how they killed Amaka’s father and when she ran to her father’s corpse they shot her as well. They killed in total at the market eleven people and disappeared through this gate,” he stressed.

Speaking on the killing during an interview with newsmen, the deputy Governor, said it was not targetted at the Igbos, as indigenous people were also affected.

“Whether in Islam or Christian religion, nobody has the right to take life. Our religions have put this straight. I, therefore, wonder why a few would be killing people who are going about their businesses. As a government, we are taking measures and we would ensure that this comes to an end,” he said.

However, many Igbos in Maiduguri wondered why nine of their kinsmen would be affected if actually the bullets were not targeted at them. Sunday Tribune, in a conversation with one of the spare parts seller at the Bank of the North area of Maiduguri learnt that, the Igbos were meeting on how to convey the corpses home.

According to one of the Igbos, Mr. Michael Osita, “This is too much for us my brother; these people are targeting us and that is the truth of the matter, otherwise, how can a flying bullet only hit the Igbos? We were told that those Kanuris who died were those who tried to prevent those boys by attempting to grab them. We were also told that some of the people around there were hailing the boys as they paved ways for them to escape. We have heard many things and since that day, the people had been trying to tell us that it was not about Igbos. We have heard them but we are waiting to hear from our leaders.”

The deputy governor who directed the manager of Maiduguri Monday market to put up adequate security measures in the market wondered how the gunmen managed to escape without any arrest despite the presence of security officials at all points around the market.

He also assured the families of those who lost their beloved ones that government will assist them in what ever capacity.

While directing the manager, Maiduguri Monday Market, Alhaji Ajiya Terab, the deputy governor said, “Sensitize all traders within the market on the importance of giving information on suspected criminals in the market to the security agencies, particularly the JTF, as such information would be treated with confidentiality.”

Earlier in his brief, Terab told the deputy governor that it had become necessary for them to close the market for one day in a show of solidarity with, and sympathy for the families of those who lost their lives and also to mourn the traders that were killed.

Narrating his story, a source told Sunday Tribune that, he was coming from the University of Maiduguri, when he saw soldiers, asking people to go back as Lagos Street was temporarily closed while gunshots were heard, which indicated trouble.

“We made a U-turn, went through Gwange to burst out along NEPA and by the time we were close to the market, we saw people running and asking us to turn back that gunmen had taken over the market. We quickly turned and went back, then we burst out through the river behind former deputy governor’s house before we could get to G.R.A.,” Nur Bakura told Sunday Tribune.

One of the driver at the Government House who did not want his name in print said that he was just coming from the market side but had to abandon the vehicle he was driving and took to his heels. “The gunshot were like no other. I did not see them but it was as if the gunshots were coming from behind me. When I came out of the market, I could not go to where I parked the car again. I ran into a nearby shop where we locked ourselves until we realized that soldiers had come and had taken control of the situation. We were told that eight people were hit by bullets and they died.”

The JTF spokesman, Lt Col. Shamsu Musa however assured the people that “Patrol has been intensified and normalcy has since been restored. Effort is on to arrest the gunmen. But so far no arrest was made as at this time.”"

Friday April 06, 2012

Gunmen suspected to be armed robbers yesterday stormed Ukpor Police Station in Nnewi South Council Area of Anambra State, killing three mobile policemen and setting the station ablaze. The hoodlums who came in a Toyota Hilux Pick-up van, and a white Hummer bus attacked the station at about 2:15a.m, shooting sporadically before hitting three mobile police officers.



The dead officers, were posted to the station on Wednesday to beef up security in the area. Daily Sun, gathered the slain cops were deployed from Mopol Base 54 Onitsha and that the robbers spoke in a strange language, calling some officers to come out and confront them, before razing part of the station with locally made grenades. They also carted away an undisclosed number of AK47rifles.



The source insisted that some of the officers at the station ran in all directions before luck ran out on the three, who could not escape during the exchange of fire.

Their bodies were said to have been deposited at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital morgue, Nnewi.



The DPO of the station, Mr. Jacob Muri, who declined comments, was said to have been contacted around 2:00a.m about the arrival of the robbers, but his efforts to mobilize more personnel from Nnewi Area Command and other neigbouring communities proved abortive.



Anambra State Police Public Relations officer, Mr. Emeka Chukwuemeka, who was touring the affected areas recently, with the new state Police Commissioner, Bala Nasarawa, turned down questions by reporters, but promised to brief journalists.

The Ukpor attack was the second of such on police stations in Anambra State in two days. The first was at Amichi Police Station in Nnewi South Local Government Area.



The incident brought to six, the number of policemen killed with one injured within two days."

Owner of a petrol station in Kaduna who vied during the governorship election in the state in 2007, Alhaji Kabiru Muhammad, was at the weekend, shot dead by yet to be identified gunmen in the state capital.



Luckily, his fiancée, who was said to be with him when the gunmen reached them, escaped death by a whisker as the gunmen spared her life by ordering her to leave.



Spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, DSP Aminu Lawan, confirmed the story but explained that the gunmen were suspected armed robbers who shot him and ran away with the deceased’s Honda Accord car.



He said investigation had commenced while alerts were sent on information about the car to all stations in the metropolis in order to aid the quick arrest of the suspects.



Kabiru had since been buried according to Islamic rites and he left behind two wives and six children.



Newsmen were told that at about 8.30pm, the gunmen stormed the highbrow Gwamna Road area in Kaduna where they met the late Kabiru in company of his fiancée.



An elder brother to the deceased, Mallam Bashir Lawal Nababa said “we just spoke with my brother a few minutes before his death because around 6pm, he called me to meet him saying he has something very important to discuss with me.



“So, we met at his filling station here in Rigasa, and after the discussion he said he was going into town while I headed for his house. I had barely entered his house when my phone rang and a friend of mine told me that my brother had been shot at Gwamna road.



“On hearing this his two wives insisted I take them to the scene, so we rushed there and when I got near the place a lot of people had gathered there. I zoomed past the place because I had confirmed that it was true and I did not want his wives to see him and the way he was shot.



'My brother was a business man and owns a filling station here in Rigasa called KAMU Oil, his name being Kabiru Muhammad. From what I know, he had no enemies because he was always trying to help people; even in our meeting before he died, he told me he wanted to donate some cars to some people in the area. He even ran for governorship of Kaduna State during the first tenure of Architect Namadi Sambo, but since then, he stayed clear of politics.



“We can only pray for Allah to grant him eternal peace and also aid the security agencies to catch the perpetrator of this evil. Our family has lost a great son.”"

No fewer than seven highway robbers have been killed on the highways in Ogun State, the police said on Tuesday.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Muyiwa Adejobi, said in a statement that the robbers were “gunned down” by policemen within one week.

According to Adejobi, the police also arrested within the same period 10 other suspects involved in various highway robbery cases along the Lagos-Ibadan and Lagos-Sagamu-Benin Expressway.

The PPRO added that the robbers were killed and others arrested while robbing road users.

He said, “The efforts of the Ogun State Police Command to rid the highways of robbers have yielded results as the command, within a week, has gunned down seven robbers who were caught in the act of robbing road users and engaged the police in gun duels. We arrested 10 suspects who have been linked with various robbery cases along the Lagos-Ibadan and Lagos-Ijebu Ode-Benin expressways.”

He added that the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Okoye Ikemefuna, had divided the expressways in the state into smaller beats of four kilometres for easy patrolling and monitoring.

Adejobi said, “The CP has ordered all DPOs whose areas of jurisdictions cover the expressway to relocate their offices to the highways and personally lead their patrol teams. With this trend of adequate patrol and monitoring, the command will definitely accord necessary and required security to all road users along the major highways in Ogun State.”

He, however, advised highway users to discountenance rumours of incessant robbery on the highways in the state, urging them to always get across to the police whenever they noticed any “unusual blockage or traffic obstruction along the Ogun expressways”.

Adejobi added, “The command wishes to disabuse the minds of road users in Ogun State of unconfirmed stories of incessant robbery attacks on its highways as widely circulated, as most of them are rumours while many drivers plying the roads take many road or traffic obstructions for robbery attacks.”"

Unknown gunmen in Kaduna on Wednesday killed a final year pupil of Imam Secondary School, Adamu Mohammed, at the Rigasa area of the state.

It was learnt that Mohammed, a member of his school’s Man O War Club, was mistakenly killed as his killers suspected he was out to attack them.

The deceased’s elder, Alhaji Maikudi Mohammed, said the boy was shot twice by the gunmen in the presence of his helpless mother who had sent him on an errand.

Narrating his ordeal, Maikudi said his brother came back home wearing his Man O War uniform and his mother sent him to buy something for her in the market when he was shot.

Maikudi said the assailants, who were three in number, shot his brother on sighting him.

He said, “Immediately he stepped out of the house, the gunmen approached him in front of the house and shot him twice.They are three young boys around 22 years; they were on a motorbike.

“When they shot him, the mother came out shouting ‘my Son is a Cardet Man O War not a soldier’, but on hearing that, they zoomed off on the same bike.

“I cannot say who they are but they are small boys. I think its because of the uniform they shot him, they thought he was a soldier.

“The boy is a final year student of Imam Secondary School, Makarfi Roa, Rigasa and writing his final WAEC exams. Our prayers as a family is that God should expose the perpetrators of this act.”

Confirming the incident, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, Aminu Lawan, a Superintendent of Police, DSP, told our correspondent that the command was aware of the incident and that they had commenced investigation into the matter."

Sources disclosed that the soldiers arrived the community at 6.30 am, putting fire on houses in a bid to raze down the three local illegal refineries that were located near the community.

Chairman of the community, Mr. Pius Oruma, who confirmed the attack, said, “Over 40 houses were burnt.”

Another community leader, Mallam Yusuf Eregbene, said: “Over four people were feared dead while thousands fled into the bush for safety, as the soldiers prevented people from carrying their belongings…”

The Mallam noted that the community was not aware of the existence of the illegal oil refineries that soldiers came to destroy, saying: “If we were aware, we would have arrested the owners. The occupations of our people are fishing and farming…It was last two years that the community stopped this local refinery business in our territory. Since then, it was free from this illegal work because we have a law that when you are caught, you will pay a fine of N50, 000.This led to the stoppage of the business because the refineries are not good for the health of our people.”

Meanwhile, police, together with Ali-kwara, on Sunday, killed four robbers on Wudil-Ajingi road .

Confirming the incident, the Kano State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Magaji Majiya, said the operation was carried out after a tip-off.

The police, in conjunction with the security outfit, acting on a tip-off, attacked the robbers around 3.00 a.m on Sunday.

The PPRO said items recovered after the operation were four AK-47 riffle, 200 live ammunition and other weapons."

FOLLOWING the brutal killing of a councillor in Barakin-Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State last week by some unknown gunmen, another three people were also slain and their corpses set ablaze in the local government area on Monday.

The local government, which is under emergency rule along with three others, in the state, has been under siege of frequent attacks by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen for quite sometime.

Last week, a councillor with the local government was cut down in his prime by some assailants who stormed his residence and shot him at close range.

Nigerian Tribune learnt that the rampaging marauders within the locality struck again on Monday at about 8.30 p.m. at Gashish in Barakin-Ladi Local Government Area and waylaid the Director of Finance and Supply, Jos East Local Government and two others who were in the same car heading towards Gashish village in the local government area.

A source close to the scene of the incident told Nigerian Tribune that the three occupants of the car were attacked by the assailants with guns and other dangerous weapons at about 8.30 p.m., riddling the vehicle with bullets.

It was learnt that after ensuring that they were dead, the gunmen drove them in the same car they were killed to a nearby bush and set the car ablaze, probably to cover up the atrocity. They were said to have bolted away before other motorists plying the road could know what was happening.

Nigerian Tribune gathered that it was the thick smoke from the burning car that attracted passersby to the scene of the dastardly act and were able to identify the occupants through the number plate and other effects.

When contacted, the Information Officer of the Special Task Force, Captain Markus Mdahyelya, who confirmed the unfortunate incident, stated that three unidentified persons were ambushed and killed on Monday in the border area between Barakin-Ladi and Bokkos local government areas of the state.

Captain Mdahyelya charged the people of the area and the entire state to take their personal security seriously and avoid going out in the night, adding that men of the STF cannot be everywhere, considering the terrain.

In another development, the Joint Task Force (JTF) in Kano, in the early hours of Tuesday, arrested two women, who were alleged to be wives of members of the dreaded Boko Haram sect at a bomb ‘factory’ raided by JTF at Haye Hotoro on the outskirts of Kano.

However, the JTF spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Ikedichi Iwehia, told journalists at the scene of the incident that the prime suspect escaped before the military men stormed the area around 2.00 a.m on Tuesday

According to him, the raid by the JTF, which took place in early hours of Tuesday, was based on a tip-off by a good Samaritan who informed the JTF of the nefarious activities of the gunmen.

He, however, noted that the JTF had been on the surveillance of the area and the actual house of the gunmen for about three days, watching as well as mapping out strategies to nip in the bud their plan to launch their operation in the state.

Lieutenant-Colonel Iwehia added that though the gunmen had already completed improvised explosive device (IEDs) allegedly waiting to carry out their mission, nemesis caught up with them.

However the “factory” has been demolished while security operatives had been placed on a red alert.

The JTF spokesman called on members of the public not to see members of the outfit as their enemies, but as patriotic people trying to restore law and order that had eluded the state."

Among those killed during the operation that lasted for about 25 minutes were native doctor Huseni Ateyike and a woman selling corn by the road side, both of whom were hit by stray bullet.

Residents said the heavily armed robbers stormed the area at about 2pm in 5 SUVs and fired indiscriminate shots, thereby scaring people away.

They headed to the First Bank branch and took away undisclosed amount of money before heading towards the local Unity Bank branch but could not gain entry.

From there, they attacked the nearby Police station and looted the armoury and also freed some detainees from the cell.

As the robbers approached, the policemen run away, residents said.

The robbers later fled on sighting a joint team of military and police personnel.

The robbers according to a source, were able to cart away some money from an old generation bank which was one its targets but were reportedly not successful at the second bank even after gaining entry into it.

Among those that was killed include a native medicine seller, known as Shuabu Achiejime and a female petty trader by the road side. Both were felled by stray bullets. Vanguard reliably gathered that the robbers stormed the town around 2pm in five jeeps fully armed with sophisticated weapons.

Police officers on duty and banks workers took to their heels during the invasion which lasted for about an hour, apparently following rumour some days earlier that an Islamic sect would attack the town.

It was said however, that the hoodlums later beat a retreat with the arrival of members of the Joint Task Forc, JTF, at the scene. Those that were injured were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.

The State Police Public Relation officer, Mr. Okasanmi Ajayi confirmed the incident but stressed that the state police headquarters had not been briefed by the Divisional Police Officer in Ankpa.

The commissioner said that the injured victims were receiving treatment at various hospitals within the city.

Meanwhile, Abubakar said that the attacker, who sustained injuries on his head and lower limbs, was being observed by doctors to ascertain his condition.

""We shall refer him to an appropriate hospital for adequate medical attention if need be, but for now he is stable under our custody and I interviewed him.

""He lost some blood, but the doctors said he was okay and they are observing to see if he will need blood transfusion.""

The police commissioner, however, did not give further details on the identity of the suspect."
499,Suicide Bomber Attacks This Day Newpaper,4/26/2012,Jabi,Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC),Federal Capital Territory,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bomb,,,,,,,,,,,School,,"casualties include bomber; simultaneous attack on newspapers in Kaduna; BH statement: 'This is a message from the public awareness department of the Jamatu Ahlis sunnah lil daawati wal jihad, a group engaged in jihad in Nigeria.

'We wish to explain about the attack we carried out on ThisDay Newspapers. Some of the reasons why we decided to attack some Media Houses, especially ThisDay, is because the paper was used in dishonouring our prophet, Mohammad (SAW) during a beauty pageant in Kaduna in November 2002.

'At that time, some people who called themselves leaders of Muslims came out to say they have forgiven those who committed the offence. 'But based on our knowledge, we know that no one has the power to forgive anyone for an offence that God himself has given judgement, especially on an offence that has to do with dishonouring Prophet Muhammad (SAW).

'No one has the power to forgive this type of offence, and the judgement is for such persons to be killed. 'This lady that committed this crime, the judgement on her is to be killed at any opportunity; and the media house is also supposed to be driven out of existence whenever there is a chance to do so.

'We are just getting the opportunity to attack the media house, and we are hoping to continue these attacks until we drive them out of existence.

'It is our hope that Allah (SWT) will help his religion.

'We know that any genuine Muslim must have been deeply touched by the Thisday incident. 'Thisday newspaper is also leading in helping the government in fighting us, alongside other media houses that we will mention soon.

'Some of the offences of Thisday and other media outlets include: firstly, during the botched attempt to rescue some kidnapped foreign nationals in Sokoto; these media houses asked us if we have anything to do with the kidnap and we said we have nothing to do with it, yet these media houses reported that we were responsible for the incident, that was a lie against us.

'Secondly, when we sent a video of our leader, Abubakar Shekau, the media houses reported things that our leader did not say, such as that in response to the president's threat to finish us in three months, we have also threatened to finish the government in three months. But the truth is, nowhere in the video did our leader say what they attributed to him.

'Thirdly, on the purported arrest of Abu Qaqa by the SSS, we have come out to tell them that the person arrested was not Abu Qaqa, yet the media continue to potray us as liars, and even said that our leader had ordered for Abu Qaqa II to be executed, and we are now searching for Abu Qaqa III.

'Recently too, they came out with another lie that one Mohammed Awwal Kontagora was the Abu Qaqa II that was executed, and that even his parents confirmed it, that was just a big lie to convince the world.

'The media also said that we have killed the father of Abu Darda, so as to pass a message to him, because he had leaked our secrets after his arrest by security agencies, and they wanted him to know that he is one of our targets.

'These are all lies, and they are many.

These media houses have committed a lot of offences that are detrimental to Islam, and we don't have the power to forgive them. We will take revenge on them by God's grace, some of these media houses have been categorised into three groups.

'The first group is the likes of ThisDay whose offences are big. 'The second group we will also attack soon are Punch, Daily Sun, Vanguard, Guardian, Nation, Tribune, and National Accord, which are all newspaper houses.

'There is also VOA Hausa radio. All these media houses we will attack them including their staff and offices, by God's grace.

'VOA Hausa for instance have recently started campaigning for people to support the government against us by exposing us.

'The next group that are on the verge of joining this list which if they are not careful we will attack very soon include, Leadership, Daily Trust, Peoples Daily and RFI (Radio France International).

'There is an online medium known as Saharareporters which have their office in New York, and which have made their site as a platform for attack against Islam. So we are warning them to stop making their site an avenue for attacking Islam, otherwise we will find a way of attacking them too.

'We resorted to using this medium to send our message instead of the normal tele-conference because of the fear by journalists, which made them refuse to conduct the conference.

'We are grateful to God for the success recorded on the attack on ThisDay, and we hope to continue such attacks.

'Finally, the government has now resorted to arresting our wives and children and also demolishing our houses, like they did in Biu recently, that is why we have also resolved to start attacking government schools, especially, tertiary ones.

'We promise to demolish 500 buildings for any one of our houses that the government destroys. 'We have already started with Gombe and Kano'.",http://allafrica.com/stories/201204270139.html,http://allafrica.com/stories/201204261007.html,http://allafrica.com/stories/201204261132.html,,,"Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria",Nigeria,"Tugela Ridley/IRIN

Nigerians listen for the latest election news on their radios in Kano, northern Nigeria, 19 April 2007.

For the first time since it began a series of deadly bomb attacks, the Boko Haram sect yesterday turned its attention to the media. It unleashed a string of coordinated attacks on three media houses in Abuja and Kaduna, killing no fewer than nine people in the process.

The three media houses attacked by the bombers were the Abuja office of ThisDay Newspaper, and then The Sun and The Moment offices in Kaduna which were hit almost simultaneously by the blasts.

Hardest hit was ThisDay whose office in Jabi, Abuja, was almost brought down by the impact of the blast that swept through the area at about 11:03am.

Witnesses said that a suicide bomber forced his way through the back gate of the Jabi office of the media empire and rammed his black Isuzu Jeep into the main building housing the printing press and other facilities. Everything went up in flames, as the bomb went off.

The impact of the blast also destroyed nearby commercial and residential buildings and caused a major apprehension and confusion around the Jabi Motor Park, which is a major exit and landing point for commuters in the Federal Capital Territory. The park is directly opposite the attacked ThisDay building.

As the bomb went off, motorists, traders and passengers at the park as well as customers of the media house scampered for safety, especially as rumours spread that another blast was imminent with the sighting of a Toyota SUV similar to the one used by the bomber, left in front of the newspaper house.

Initially, journalists were barred from the scene of the blast by the combined team of riot policemen, anti-bomb disposal men and soldiers, who cordoned off the area right from Jabi junction.

ThisDay has, in a statement released yesterday, claimed that five people died during the incident, saying that the victims comprised the bomber, its security official and three passers-by.

A NEMA official in Kaduna, who sought anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the event, confided in our correspondents that four people died during the attack in Kaduna.

The evacuation and rescue operations were shielded from the press and the dead and injured taken away before journalists were allowed into the premises.

However, the group executive director of ThisDay, Ireogbu Israel, confirmed that the company's security and support staff were mostly affected by the blast. Israel put the number of those killed at three and the wounded at six.

He said, ""We have been able to identify some of the dead with their uniforms and have taken them to the mortuary. Those injured have also been taken to the hospital.""

The FCT police commissioner, Mr. Ade Sinaba, and the comptroller-general of the Federal Fire Service visited the scene of the blast and supervised the evacuation of the dead and the wounded.

El-Rufa'i commiserates with Thisday

Former FCT minister Mallam Nasiru el-Rufai, who visited the scene of the blast, said he went there as a member of the newspaper's editorial board to see things for himself.

The former minister said, ""Well, I came in as a member of the editorial board; I am very sad. I can only say ""Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilahi Rajiun"", meaning ""From God we came and to Him we shall return. He left immediately after uttering those words.

We can't be intimidated - NPAN

Meanwhile, the Newspaper Proprietors' Association of Nigeria (NPAN) said yesterday that its members would not be cowed by the attack on media organisations in Abuja and Kaduna.

In a statement signed by its general secretary, Comfort Obi, the association condemned the attack and described it as not only insensitive, barbaric and retrogressive but also an unwarranted attack on free press in the country.

The statement reads in part, ""The NPAN finds it difficult to understand why the sect would make the media a target, when the media is only performing its social and constitutional duty of reporting events as they unfold.

It is this call to duty that explains why members of the sect always have a space in the media when its spokesperson(s) call in to grant interviews, or press statements. Their views are usually well reported.

""However, if the current attack is to intimidate the press, we hasten to say that we shall neither be cowed nor intimidated as we shall continue to discharge our professional responsibilities without fear or favour.

""We hasten to task the government, again, on the need to guarantee the security of lives and property. It does seem that nowhere is safe.""

There had been earlier warnings by the Boko Haram sect of its intent to launch an onslaught on the Nigerian media.

Jonathan, Obama condemn attacks

President Goodluck Jonathan also condemned the attack on the media, asking them not to succumb to the whims of those who were trying to stop them from carrying out their campaign for peace, justice and equity.

In a statement by his special adviser on media and publicity, the president described the attack as ignoble, misguided, horrendous and wicked but assured, as usual, that his government was committed to the protection of lives and property in the country.

The statement reads in part: ""President Jonathan reaffirmed the commitment of the federal government to continue to uphold the constitutional right to freedom of expression in general and of press freedom in particular, pledging that criminal elements bent on instilling fear in the minds of Nigerians and foreigners will not succeed.

""The president urged media practitioners not to be dissuaded from carrying out their fearless campaign for peace, justice and equity as democracy cannot flourish without press freedom.

""President Jonathan commiserated with the bereaved families and other innocent victims of the explosions, and also prayed that Almighty God would grant them succour in their moment of grief and the souls of the departed, peaceful repose.""

Also, United States President Barrack Obama has condemned the attacks on ThisDay, The Sun and The Moment newspapers in Nigeria by Boko Haram and called for a comprehensive probe into the attacks.

In a press release made available to our correspondent yesterday night, the US leader said that: ""we strongly condemn these attacks on the two offices of the newspaper ThisDay, both in Abuja and Kaduna. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the loved ones and those who were killed or injured.

This is an attack not only on innocent people but on free speech itself in Nigeria, and we call for a full investigation in holding those responsible to account""

""We are continuing to look at Boko Haram in this context. We haven't made any decisions yet. Frankly, we're not in a position from here to evaluate responsibility. I think we will, obviously, offer any support to the Nigerians that they may require.

But that said, we share the concerns about the threat that Boko Haram poses, and this is among the reasons that we cooperate so strongly with Nigeria in terms of not only security support but also political and economic support in the north so that the vulnerable populations in the north of Nigeria can't be sort of attracted and coerced by Boko Haram""

Also, the US Embassy in Abuja has warned U.S. citizens to take additional precautions while living in or visiting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, stressing that they should maintain a high state of vigilance and personal security awareness, particularly in and around Abuja, Federal Capital Territory, near Nigerian government facilities, diplomatic missions, large gathering places, hotels, markets and malls, and places of worship.

Responding to the attack, the chairman and founder of ThisDay, Mr. Nduka Obaigbena, described the blast on the three media houses in Abuja and Kaduna as an attack on Nigerian journalism.

Obaigbena said, ""Today, Nigerian journalism was attacked, but the truth will not be cowed.""

Residents nab bomber in Kaduna

Meanwhile The State Security Service (SSS) has confirmed that five persons died in bomb blasts that rocked the some media houses in Abuja and Kaduna.

The SSS deputy director of public relations, Marilyn Ogar, in a statement yesterday identified one of the assailants of the blast in the ThisDay office in Kaduna as Umaru Mustapha of Maiduguri, Borno State.

Ogar also disclosed that the bomber, who was overpowered by some gallant Nigerians, came in a cream Honda Accord (Academy) She said: ""Mustapha and another man drove into R9, Kontagora Road, Ahmadu Bello Way in a cream-coloured Honda Accord (Academy), registration number AL 306 MKA, at about 11am.

That address belongs to SOJ Global Communications and Investment Limited Plaza, and houses correspondents of The Sun, Thisday and The Moment newspapers.""

According to Ogar, Mustapha alighted with a container of improvised explosive device (IED).

""He was immediately challenged by two gallant Nigerians following which he threw the bomb at them and it denoted, killing them instantly. Subsequently, Mustapha pulled out a pistol and fired several shots in the air in an attempt to escape.

""He was however caught and subdued by brave members of the public who refused to be intimidated and handed him over to security forces. Nine persons were injured and are receiving treatment.""

""At about the same time, at the premises of Thisday newspaper in Abuja, another car, a dark green Isuzu jeep outfitted with bombs forced its way in, detonated and killed the suicide bomber.

Ogar confirmed that two other persons were confirmed killed, while five persons were injured in the Abuja attack.

The SSS spokesman, who expressed hope that the attacks would not deter reportage of issues that affect Nigerians, applauded the gallantry and patriotism of the members of the public who risked their lives to save others.

Boko Haram claims responsibility, says more attacks on media coming

The Boko Haram sect has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that rocked the Kaduna and Abuja offices of ThisDay, saying that the Nigerian media should expect more suicide bombings from them.

It said it carried out the attack to sound a note of warning to media houses that it would no longer tolerate reports which misrepresent them in the media or blame them for attacks they know nothing about.

A spokesperson for the sect, Abul Qaqa, told an internet medium that his organisation was fed up with the deliberate misinformation being peddled about it in the Nigerian and foreign media.

Qaqa said: ""We have repeatedly cautioned reporters and media houses to be professional and objective in their reports. This is a war between us and the government of Nigeria; unfortunately the media have not been objective and fair in their report of the ongoing war; they chose to take sides.""

When asked why ThisDay appeared specifically chosen for the attack, Qaqa said that ThisDay's ""sins"" are more grievous.

""It is not only ThisDay that has been engaged in negative media campaign, fictional stories and constantly promoting fake stories by the JTF to give an impression that they are making headway against us, yet there is no time the media investigated further as an objective and responsible bystander in this war.

""But the sins of ThisDay are more. They recently said our Imam executed me, which is false. Here I am speaking to you, I am alive and healthy.""

The group's spokesman further warned of more attacks on the media.

""We have just started this new campaign against the media and we will not stop here, we will hit the media hard since they have refused to listen to our plea for them to be fair in their reportage,"" he said.

Qaqa also said his group would give further information on biases by the media.

""In the coming days, we will give details and instances where the media have not been fair to us and why we are going to attack them as well.""

""But each time we say something it is either changed or downplayed. But when our enemy says something even without logical proof, it is blown out of proportion.""

""We have repeatedly asked some reporters to retract some stories or even give us the right of reply but none of these requests was given to us.""

He identified three instances where he claimed his group was deliberately misrepresented by the media. The first, according to him, was the rumour of his capture by the Nigerian intelligence agencies.

""Some reporters are aware that I am Abul Qaqa; they know my voice through our long interactions and they also know the role of Abu Darda who heads the enlightenment committee and sometimes facilitates interviews; yet they (media) go by the unsubstantiated view of government that Abul Qaqa is in custody and I am the new spokesman or number two,"" he said.

The second misrepresentation, according to Qaqa, was the reporting on the kidnappings of foreigners in the northern part of Nigeria.

""Another issue was the recent kidnappings in the North; we were clear with our position as a group during a teleconference with reporters but we were shocked the next day when newspaper headlines added a lot of things which I never said during that interview.""

The third example, Qaqa said, is the mistranslation of the video the group posted recently.

""Another example is the recent video posted on YouTube by our Imam; I challenge every Nigerian to watch that video again.

There is no place our imam either said he will crush President Jonathan or issued an ultimatum to the government in Nigeria; but nearly all papers carried very wrong and mischievous headlines."""

The bomb exploded at about 8.45 a.m. when workers were resuming for work after the weekend break.

Police Public Relations Officer, Ibiang Mbasike, confirmed the blast.

""Yes, there was a blast at the Ministry of Finance. There are casualties, but we are not sure of the figures for now,'' he said.

Police sources said the bombers must have targeted the Police Commissioner as the explosive was thrown at his convoy.

One of the explosives hit the rider leading the Police Commissioner's convoy.

NO fewer than seven people were brutally killed while 10 others sustained injuries in an early morning attack by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State on Thursday.

Nigerian Tribune gathered that the assailants, in their large number, stormed Rinyam-Tahoss village in the local government area in the early hours of Thursday, while the people were still in bed.

It was learnt that the suspected Fulani herdsmen, who laid ambush and positioned themselves at various strategic parts of the village, fired several volleys of gunshots into the air to herald their arrival in the village.

A source close to the local government revealed that the marauders shot the seven people who were trying to escape into the nearby bush while those who sustained injuries were hacked down with cutlasses.

Nigerian Tribune learnt that after two hours of uninterrupted assault, the assailants bolted away before the arrival of men of the Special Task Force who arrived one hour after the suspected Fulani herdsmen had disappeared.

The seven people killed were four adults and three children while those who sustained injuries are currently at the Vom Christian Hospital, receiving treatment.

The entire Riyom Local Government Area has been under severe attack by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen and close to 80 people have been killed in the past one month in various villages within the council area.

Some journalists also escaped death narrowly at Kak village in the council area recently, when a group of armed Fulani herdsmen on the prowl in the council, opened fire on their convoy

Confirming the incident, the member representing Riyom constituency in the state House of Assembly, Honourable Daniel Dem, condemned the attack and described it as unfortunate and called on the government to save his people from total annihilation.

“The attack has become a daily occurrence. Today, alone, seven people were shot dead and several others are receiving treatment from gunshots and matchete cuts at the Vom Christian Hospital. I want to appeal to my people to remain calm and not to take laws into their own hands, as appropriate measures are being taken to bring to an end the senseless killings,” he said.

The legislator lamented that despite the fact that the local government is under a state of emergency, people are being killed on a daily basis and called on the security personnel deployed in the area to be proactive and bring the culprits to book."

The gunmen blocked the entrances to the market shortly after sunset, hurled explosives and opened fire on fleeing people hours after traders repelled a robbery attempt and lynched one of the robbers, witnesses said.

Sixty two other people were reported injured in the attack, while at least 50 cattle were either shot dead or burnt alive. A number of vehicles were also torched by the gunmen.

There were conflicting figures yesterday of the dead from hospital and police authorities, and the death toll may be higher than the figures given because many corpses were taken for burial by relations.

""I have counted 56 bodies at the morgue and I am sure that the death toll could rise in view of the serious nature of injuries sustained,"" a nurse at Potiskum hospital said. ""The Potiskum mortuary is made up of a room and a parlour and I counted the 56 in the parlour only. I didn't go into the inner room.""

But Police Commissioner Moses Onirepi said they confirmed 34 killed.

It was not clear who was responsible for the attack and no group claimed responsibility, but the Boko Haram sect had carried out many deadly attacks in Potiskum before.

The Police commissioner said Boko Haram must have been behind the attack because that was the way they operate.

""Everybody knows the modus operandi of BH (Boko Haram): they threw explosives and used guns,"" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. ""The gunfire lasted for almost an hour.""

In the initial attack at about 11am on Wednesday, gunmen stormed the market firing, leading to the death of three people while one of the robbers was caught and lynched by marketers, witness Aliyu Yusuf said.

""While we were in the business, a gang of armed robbers drove into the market with a Volkswagen Golf car. They started shooting and robbed people of monies and valuables.

""But people resisted and caught one of them whose ammunition has finished. He was beaten up by a mob to death and his corpse was burnt down while the remaining robbers escaped,"" he said.

Aliyu said at about 7pm, the robbers returned to the market and blocked all the entry gates. They then began throwing explosives and firing at people in the market.

""They stood strategically by the market gates. The market started burning and people started rushing out for safety. They took that advantage and continue shooting people indiscriminately. They burnt down all the buildings, cars and structures in the market,"" he said.

When our correspondent visited the scene yesterday, some corpses were still in the burnt market area. There were also burnt remains of 10 cattle and 15 vehicles.

""When one of these robbers was killed in the morning we were all celebrating but what people saw in the evening was terror,"" Aliyu said.

Another witness Adamu Garin Abba told Daily Trust how the initial raid was repelled.

""A robber seized money from a woman in the market, and started moving confidently. She screamed for help, and mobs trailed the bandit and killed him. I cannot quantify the number people killed but I counted more than 50 cows burnt,"" he said.

A bullet in the jaw

At the Potiskum General Hospital where the injured and lots of corpses were taken, hundreds of people were seen trooping in to trace their loved ones.

A medic, Dr D.M. Muna, told Daily Trust that those who sustained gunshot injuries in the attack were undergoing surgery.

""Most of these victims suffered bullet wounds, we already operated on some with complex problems, those suspected to be burnt by flames were also dressed,"" he said.

Sarkin Fawan Bula, who was shot in the jaw, was seen in hospital bed after the bullet was extracted.

Livestock feed seller Malam Abbagana wept as he told our correspondent how he escaped alive.

""I was about to escape through the back door when one of the bandits aimed at me, because by then the whole market was burning, the only saving grace was to hide under the livestock feed, but they threw an explosive on the feed, that was how I got burnt,"" he said.

Secretary of the Amalgamated Cattle Rearers and Breeders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Abubakar Dankawu, said the attack would cripple livestock business in the area.

""Security operations should be intensified to prevent a recurrence,"" he said.

Victims of the attack complained of lack of prompt help from security agents.

""If they had come to our rescue in time, a lot of lives would have been saved,"" a victim said.

A concerned citizen in Potiskum said, ""Several check points were mounted, in fact the cattle market is circled by JTF check points, but upon all that the bandits unleashed terror for more than one hour without being caught.""

Yobe State commissioner for Animals and Fisheries, Alhaji Bukar Idris Machinama, who visit the scene said the state government would study the situation and improve the security situation.

The Emir of Fika and chairman of the Yobe State Council of Chiefs was also at the hospital to sympathise with relations of the victims.

Later yesterday, Governor Ibrahim Gaidam visited the burnt market and the injured victims in hospital, where he pledged government's assistance to them.

""Government will compensate the victims and handle all medical bills of those who sustained injuries in the attack and treated in the hospital,"" he said.

He said the attack was heinous and despicable. He said a committee would be set up, comprising senior government officials and leaders the cattle marketers, to assess the damage."

“We have lost our homes and everything in them. Our sons and daughters have been slain; our husbands can no longer visit their farms; we are in hunger and distress. We would rather flee this village than die here either by the sword of the Fulani herdsmen or in hunger.”

This was the lamentation of Berom women, who have lost virtually all they had to Fulani persistent attacks, as they flee Kak village in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State, after a recent attack that claimed the lives of over 10 persons.

Meanwhile, the member representing Riyom constituency in the state House of Assembly, Hon. Daniel Dem, and a team of journalists, who had gone to the affected villages for on-the-spot assessment narrowly escaped death at Kak village when a group of armed Fulani herdsmen attacked the village.

Riyom Local Government has been under Fulani attack in the last three weeks with the recent one being on Monday night when over 10 persons were slain and scores of houses torched. Their representative in the state House of Assembly had therefore led a team of journalists from Jos, the state headquarters, to assess situation.

The lawmaker and the journalists were in the village at about 10:30am yesterday interviewing victims and cross-checking facts with Nigeria Red Cross members when the armed Fulani herdsmen struck again. They hid behind nearby rocks and fired gun shots sporadically into the village.

Dem and the journalists had to abandon their vehicles and ran into the bush to take cover, after which they immediately escaped from the village.

The villagers, who had earlier gathered their luggage to flee the village, were not left behind. The villagers had returned to the village from their displaced camps to evacuate their food stuff and domestic animals when the lawmaker and journalists visited.

Among the journalists who escaped death were Yusufu Aminu of The Nation, Yemi Kosoko of Channels Television, Hilary Kasmir of Nigeria Standard, Samson Omale of Silverbird Television, and their counterparts from the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and the state Radio and Television Corporation (PRTVC).

Dem, who after escaping to safety and could not hold back tears, said: “I have witnessed it live. I thought it was a joke, I never knew this is what my people have been passing through. I had a close shave with death, you newsmen have seen it yourselves that the victims are not just telling lies about their predicament.

“I’m happy no journalist is hurt, but my people are in danger. There is no security to help them out. Government knows about the problem, security agents know of the attacks, but no one is responding to my distress call.

“I mean the Federal Government imposed a state of emergency on this council yet all these things are still happening. The worst the government has done is to withhold the monthly allocation of this local government, such that there is no fund to handle the security challenges.”

“Federal Government has no reason holding monthly allocation of councils under state of emergency. The idea is compounding their problems; it is high time these withheld allocations were released or they should send special funds for emergency administration,"" he added.

So far, the Fulani have attacked over 10 Berom villages in the last three weeks, with attendant loss of lives. The villages include Tahoss, Bangai, Sopp, Angwa Werem, Dajol, Sho, Dung, Bashit, Fan, Rwa and Gwom.

Residents of the attacked villages have fled to other villages that may also be victims in the near future."

A statement from the Special Adviser on media affairs to the governor, Tony Iyare, explained that Oyerinde, 44, was shot dead by four gunmen who invaded his house located in Ugbor area, Benin City around 1 a.m.

He said: ""Shortly after they stormed the compound, they bounded the security guard while two of them forced their way through the front door and made straight for his bedroom.

""On recognising that it was Mr. Oyerinde's brother-in-law who was actually sleeping on the bed, they immediately left him and went for the wife, Funke, asking her to lead them to the husband who, unknown to them, was sleeping in the living room.

""On sighting him, they instantly fired four shots, one to the head, chest, abdomen and hip, killing Oyerinde instantly. The gunmen later fled without taking anything from the house.

The killing of Mr. Oyerinde is coming exactly six days after Governor Adams Oshiomhole's convoy was attacked along Warrake-Auchi road, by a truck that curiously veered off its track and headed straight for the staff car, missing it by the whiskers. Three journalists were killed while others including security details, sustained various degree of injuries.

""Curiously, at about 2.45am the following day, the home of the Information Commissioner, Mr Louis Odion, was invaded by four gunmen who also missed him because he opted to pass the night in a friend's house located in another part of the city. A member of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon Johnson Oghuma was also similarly attacked by gunmen recently. Oghuma who represents Etsako Central had his car riddled with bullets as he was on his way to Fugar, his hometown,"" Iyare added.

Odion had at a press briefing last Sunday, raised fears that top government functionaries were being targeted for elimination.

Oyerinde who read Mass Communication at the University of Lagos, was seconded from the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to work for the comrade governor in November 2007. He is survived by his wife, Funke, four children and an aged mother.

According to the media adviser, ""This sequence of sordid events coming each time on the eve of the flag off of Governor Oshiomhole's campaign, raises grave concern and therefore demands thorough investigation by the security forces.""

Edo state governorship elections is scheduled for July 14, 2012.

The discovery was said to have thrown the university community into confusion. Residents ran helter-skelter when news of the explosives filtered in.

The bombs, almost set to explode, according to an eyewitness, were carefully abandoned at the Sports Complex, and the faculties of science and law of the university.

""We were so confused, but thank God they were detected and defuse successfully,"" an eyewitness said.

The school is currently on vacation but the administrative section and other units had already resumed for the day's work when police anti-squad swung into action following a prompt alert by a resident of the university.

It was learnt that, immediately the three explosives were discovered, the university authority alerted the police who dispatched its bomb disposal unit to the sites to defuse the bombs without causing any harm.

Spokesman of the Kano command of the Nigeria Police, ASP Magaji Musa Majiya, confirmed the incident, saying that the school drew the attention of the police to the suspicious parcels and the command dispatched its experts to defuse the explosives.

He stated that the bomb experts cordoned off the entire area before they went into action and successfully defused the three explosives.

Security was beefed up at the university as traffic leading to the Kabuga campus of the university was diverted by the Joint Task Force.

On Sunday, April 29, 2012 some unknown gunmen attacked Christian worshipers at the old campus of the university leading to the death of 16 people and wounding of several others.

As confusion and panic at the old campus of the Bayero University was gradually easing, another institution, Kano Federal College of Education, located a few meters away from the old campus of the university, was also thrown into confusion following the sound of a tyre burst around the area.

The development forced vehicles and students to run in different direction out of fear of possible explosion.

Motorists plying the ever-busy BUK Road were seen hitting one another in a desperate move to escape from the sound of the heavy explosion which they thought was a bomb.

At the time of filing this report, the institution was virtually deserted.

Four injured as bomb blast rocks hotel in Bauchi

Meanwhile, no fewer than four people on Monday night received various degrees of injury as a result of a bomb blast which occurred at the People's Hotel in Bayan Gari area of the Bauchi metropolis.

The event happened at about 9pm, just as people in the areas panicked and traders and achaba riders hurriedly closed their businesses.

Confirming the incident, the commissioner of police, Bauchi State command, Muhammad Ladan, explained that his men were deployed immediately to the scene when he received the information adding that three men and a woman were affected by the blast.

He said that the victims were rushed to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH), Bauchi, for treatment and that nobody died as a result of the dastardly event.

He claimed that the suspected bomber was injured and was being interrogated by the police.

Ladan condemned the despicable act and urged the general public in the state to complement the effort of the security agencies by providing them with useful information that will help to avert the recurrence of such ugly incidents.

LEADERSHIP gathered that parts of the hotel where the explosion occurred were damaged.

Musa in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service monitored in Kaduna, however, said the JTF is empowered to arrest and detain any person suspected to be a member of the Boko Haram Sect, but has not killed any innocent person or people.

He challenged those that accused the JTF of killing innocent people in Maiduguri to prove their case above any reasonable doubt.

""There is always the authority above the JTF that they can report the JTF to for redress, and we challenge any person to come up with such case where we arrested or killed any person or people,"" said Musa

The JTF commander also said their presence is for security of the people in that town and nothing more, adding that the JTF would not fold arms to allow people commit all such crimes against humanity.

However, one of the community leaders and a lawmaker said they prefer to stay without the military and accused the JTF of arresting and killing innocent civilians in Yobe State and Maiduguri, which even caused a demonstration by some youths two days ago."

Two policemen including a mobile police officer and a sergeant were also killed on the same Friday night when unknown gunmen attacked a divisional police headquarters in Misau local government area of Bauchi State.

Also there were attacks in Shira and Tafawa Balewa local governments.

Two people were killed while several others were injured by gunmen in Kutaru village, near Zwall in Tafawa Balewa local government area of the state.

The secretary of the Sayawa Elders' Council in the local government, Barrister Bukata Zhadi, said the attackers who were armed with sophisticated weapons stormed the village around 1 am and killed two people and injured many who have been admitted in a hospital in Plateau State.

Zhadi appealed to the government and relevant authorities to come to the aid of their people to avoid unnecessary molestations, saying the despicable acts have continued to throw them into panic.

The hoodlums whose number is yet to be ascertained have also raided a new-generation bank in the area where they reportedly bombed it and carted away undisclosed sum of money.

Eyewitnesses revealed that one of the miscreants was eventually killed during an exchange of gunshots between them and a team of army personnel at a checkpoint along Azare highway in the state.

The state commissioner of police, Muhammed Ladan, who confirmed the incident to LEADERSHIP SUNDAY on phone, said he was yet to assess the level of damage as at press time.

""Yes, it is true that there was an attack in Yana town in Misau local government area. Hoodlums attacked the divisional police headquarters and a bank with guns and explosives.

Aslo, the village head of Rigasa, a surbub in Kaduna, Mal. Yahaya Mohammed Danmadami, popularly known as Sarkin Arewa, was gunned down in his house by heavily armed militants.

LEADERSHIP SUNDAY gathered that after killing him in his house at PRP bus-stop junction, the same gang of gunmen traced a police sergeant and killed him 30 minutes later.

A top security source who pleaded for anonymity said the group which perpetrated the act were members of the Boko Haram sect.

Our source who was part of the reinforcement to Rigasa said the traditional ruler, Sarkin Arewa Rigasa Malam Yahaya was shot along Danmadami Road in the area. The police officer was followed and gunned down again by the same set of gunmen who, after killing him, fled the scene without any interference by security agencies.

Confirming his father's death, one of the sons of the village head, Mohammed Kabiru, said the gunmen who were three in number shot his father and took off immediately.""They came on a motorcycle, entered inside the room and opened fire on my father. Immediately they shot him and left, we took him to hospital but he could not survive the bullet wounds,"" he said.

LEADERSHIP SUNDAY learnt that the situation has created panic among other traditional rulers in the area.

Our correspondent gathered that the sect members have embarked on killing traditional rulers on the grounds that traditional rulers are aiding security agencies with information about their movement in the community.

LEADERSHIP SUNDAY gathered that this is the first time the group would be killing a royal father. As thousands of residents have abandoned their homes for fear of being attacked by the sect, more armed soldiers and policemen have been drafted to beef up security in the area.

The Friday killings have brought the number to 15 of officers and other paramilitary that have fallen to bandits' bullets recently in the area.

The Kaduna State police command confirmed the killings, saying that an investigation had since commenced with a view to arresting the perpetrators.

According the police public relation officer, DSP Aminu Lawan, the bandits killed the village head and the sergeant and ran away.

In another development, unidentified gunmen on Friday night killed one Baba Alhaji who is a brother to a veteran politician in Gombe State.

He was shot dead around Bolari area within Gombe metropolis and he immediately died on the spot while being rushed to the hospital.

The situation created panic within the area as people were seen running helter-skelter for fear of being attacked. Most of them closed their businesses and ran back to their houses.

Security operatives cordoned off the area by adopting stop-and-search.

According to a relative of late Baba, funeral prayer was performed in their family house and he had been buried according to Islamic rites.

In yet another development in Taraba State, a suspected militant on motorbike threw a grenade close to a commercial bank in Ungwan Dorawa. Hundreds of people panicked and took to their heels as the device exploded. A source disclosed that a few people were wounded."

“Eye witnesses said the motorcyclist threw the explosive devise and ran away immediately. None of them was able to identify him,” he said.

Mbaseiki said the police were investigating the matter and appealed to the public to assist the police with vital information that would lead to crime prevention.

The assailants, our reporter gathered, drove to the area in three Volkswagen cars in an operation which lasted about an hour.

The assailants were said to have operated without any resistance as they overpowered all the policemen on duty who took to their heels after the killing of two officers.

Meanwhile, Borno police command's spokesman, ASP Samuel Tizhe, has confirmed the attack to newsmen.

The police spokesman, however, said that the assailants attempted to take away arms and ammunition without success as they were chased away by the officers on duty.

The villages are Bulkutu, Wakta, Jakute and Suwa, according to people who fled the violence and took refuge in neighbouring settlements.

Residents of the affected areas said the incident was a reprisal attack by Fulani over an earlier attack against their kinsmen by the villagers in January.

They said the assailants, who came in large numbers, invaded the communities killing people, burning homes and destroying farm produce.

""Our entire villages were completely razed down,"" James Aboki, who escaped from one of the villages, said. ""Adults were mostly affected.""

Aboki, now taking refuge in nearby Tigno village, said domestic animals were not left out in the attack.

Helen Thompson, who also escaped the attack, said at least 1,000 women and children that fled the areas were taking refuge in Tigno, Lamurde and Lafia.

Daily Trust reports that the Tigno Primary School premises have been turned into a camp for survivors of the violence, with some of them sleeping under trees.

Many residents fled before the arrival of the attackers as they had heard of the impending attacks, they said.

They alleged that the authorities had been notified of the impending attacks but adequate protection was not provided.

Others, however, said that police were deployed to prevent the attack but the attackers followed bush path and surprised the police.

Authorities declined comments over the causes or the exact nature of the attack.

State Police commissioner Mark Adamu Idako, who confirmed the incident to Daily Trust by telephone, said it was difficult to ascertain the casualty figures by the time our reporter called.

""We received a distress call from the affected villages but due to the bad road leading to the areas it took our men about an hour to get to the villages,"" he said.

Idako said the situation was under control, and urged residents to remain calm and not to take the laws into their own hands. He added that the police were working to establish exactly who the attackers were.

On Friday, the investigation panel set up by the Adamawa State Government on reprisal attacks in four local government areas said it found that at least 67 people were killed, 285 people displaced and property worth N1.4 billion destroyed during the incidents of violence.

The committee investigated reprisals in Numan, Lamurde, Demsa, Girei and Guyuk local government areas after violence in Mubi and Jimeta.

3 poker players killed in Kano

Gunmen yesterday opened fire on a group of men playing cards in Tukuntawa area of Kano, killing three and injuring five others.

The attack, which residents said was the second in as many weeks on poker joints in the area, happened around 6pm at the popular Layin Shehu Zaiti.

Witnesses said the place was packed with card players when four gunmen arrived on two motorcycles and started shooting indiscriminately.

Daily Trust gathered that three people died immediately, while four others were taken to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in critical conditions.

Kano State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Musa Magaji Majiya, confirmed yesterday's attack but did not give casualty figures.

A similar assault on another poker game spot two weeks ago, left a teenager seriously wounded, residents said.

A resident who does not want his name mentioned said a warning letter had been sent to the playing card group before yesterday's attack. ""The letter threatened them with grievous consequences should they refuse to vacate the spot as instructed,"" he said."

Another public primary school was also hit same night by unknown gunmen.

The newly-built Islamiyya school at Farawa was attacked around sunset when Muslims were preparing for the Maghrib prayers, residents said.

They said they heard loud blasts from within the school premises, followed by gunfire, sparking chaos as people run back into their homes.

""We heard the sound of three powerful blasts which were followed by gunshots as people were heading for the mosques,"" a resident said, asking not to be named.

""Later in the evening we learnt that it was the newly-constructed Islamiyya school which was about to be commissioned by the state government that was attacked.""

The blasts left gaping holes in the classroom buildings and tore off part of the green roofing which has the 'Kwankwasiyya' inscription emblazoned on it in white colour.

Frontage and back sides of at least three classrooms in the one-storey building were heavily damaged.

But it seemed the explosions did not ignite fires.

Kano has seen sporadic gun and bomb attacks since the January 20 major strike blamed on the Boko Haram sect, mainly targeting security personnel and institutions. The Bayero University was also attacked last month.

Residents of Farawa area said Wednesday's Islamiyya school attack was strange because the sect blamed for previous attacks claims to be propagating wider application of Islamic law.

""We find the attack on Islamic school very strange and disturbing. We heard stories of attacks on formal educational institutions in places like Maiduguri and elsewhere but we have never heard of anything like an attack on Islamic schools by these people. The government must truly do something to bring this situation to an end,"" he said.

Daily Trust learnt yesterday that security personnel found two home-made explosives that did not go off at the school premises.

The other school that was attacked in Kano on Wednesday was the newly-built Ja'en Special Primary School, located at a remote part of Sharada Industrial Estate. The attack happened around midnight, residents said.

""The deafening sounds of the explosives woke all of us up around midnight. We did not know what happened until in the morning when pupils who reported to the school were turned back,"" a resident told Daily Trust.

The one-story building, which also bears the Kwankwasiyya political slogan on its roof, had its ceilings and doors damaged by the blasts.

The impact of the blasts also completely shattered the windscreens and side glasses of a grey-coloured Volkswagen salon car that was parked in front of the structure.

Our reporter could not gain entry into the school compound because the gates had been locked by the school's security men.

""We stopped our children from going to the school because we are not certain about their safety,"" a parent of one of the pupils in the school told our correspondent.

Sources said some unexploded bombs similar to those found at the school in Farawa had been evacuated by security personnel.

Nobody was killed in the two incidents.

Confirming the attacks, a spokesman for the police in Kano, Magaji Musa Majiya, said, ""One unexploded device was found at Ja'en primary school while two others were found at the Farawa school by our operatives. They had all been demobilised.""

He added: ""No arrests were made and no lives were lost in both incidents.""

There was no immediate reaction from the Kano State government. Education commissioner, Alhaji Faruk Iya, did not answer calls made to him by our reporter to seek for his comments on the two incidents."

The Bayelsa State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps was on Wednesday thrown into grief after its official, Mr. Bassey Inoyo, was allegedly tortured to death by policemen.

It was learnt that Inoyo, a senior FRSC official, was due to proceed on retirement leave in November.

An eyewitness told our correspondent that trouble started on Tuesday morning when a police officer from Special Anti-Robbery Squard Unit felt aggrieved over the conduct of a road safety official.

He said, “The road safety official who is serving in Sagbama Local Government Area of the state was blocked by a car. He was waiting for the car to be driven out before driving in. In the process, he temporarily blocked the narrow road.

“But the police officer who was in mufti hooted his horn many times signaling the road safety officer to clear the road for him to pass. Eventually, the road safety man drove in and parked but already the police officer in mufti was aggrieved. He came down from his vehicle and descended on the road safety official.”

The source alleged that the policeman tore the FRSC official’s rank and his uniform and then engaged him in a fight.

Some road safety officials were said to have rushed to the scene to assist their colleagues and in the process, the policeman, who drove in a private car was injured.

Our source, who pleaded anonymity, said, “The police officer phoned his office and complained that road safety officials were about to kill him.

“About eight SARS operatives went to the road safety office with guns and were shooting as if there was a civil war. They were also beating everybody they saw there to the extent that road safety men started pulling off their uniforms and running away. They fired teargas too.”

The source added that Inoyo an elderly man, was apprehended by the policemen.

“The elderly man, the one that died today, could not run like others. They beat him until he fell down. They were stepping on his head with their boots. The head, the nose, the mouth, were all bleeding.

“They were beating him with the butt of the gun. When he fell down, they were dragging him on the ground like an animals SARS office. He died this morning. This is the height of callousness. I have never seen this type of thing before. This was an eyesore. The man they killed is due for retirement. He was supposed to retire February next year.” he said.

A source said the Commissioner of Police, Chris Olakpe visited the office of the road safety and held a meeting with the sector commander.

When contacted, Olakpe, said the matter which occurred barely a month after the case of a prisons inspector, allegedly killed by policemen had been resolved amicably between the two sister agencies."

Ploughing the fields.

A renewed attack by Fulani herdsmen on Tiv community in Gwer West local government area of Benue State Monday claimed eight lives while several others sustained injuries.

However, a resident said the herdsmen stormed Tyoughatee and Gbaange-Tongov district of the council last Saturday night killing maiming and burning; down farmlands, houses and huts.

Speaking to journalists, the traditional ruler of Nagi, Chief Daniel Abomtse, decried the continuous attacks on his domain as well as the frequent nonchalant attitude by State and Federal Government towards the security of the people.

Abomtse said he had informed the state government as well as security agencies in a letter dated May 15 entitled 'Grand Plan to Annihilate Gwer West People By Fulani Herdsmen and their Mercenaries; and frowned on the nonchalant attitude shown by the state government and security operatives to stop the attack.

""Information had it that the Fulani herdsmen intend to invade Gwer West crossing from the Obendo, Ijiwo Akpanaja axis in Nasarawa State into Tyoughatee and Gbaange/Tongov district of Gwer West council, at a location between Mbaku communities of Makurdi and invade the whole of the district which stretches 16 kilometres of Makurdi-Naka road and then advance to Naka town, headquarters of Gwer West LGA.

""They also plan to attack and burn down my palace and residence with explosives and sophisticated automatic fire arms,"" part of letter read.

He said the attack took place late Saturday night when the herdsmen invaded Tyoughatee village, an attack that lasted till dawn and left 10 persons dead with some still not accounted for while many unidentified corpses littered around the affected communities.

Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Ejike Alaribe, said the police could only confirm five deaths arising from the conflict."

Some officials of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps on Wednesday in Abeokuta, the state capital, allegedly clubbed a middle-aged man to death for driving on a yet-to-be inaugurated six-lane road.

About 15 TRACE officials allegedly pounced on the man, Samuel Adoke, and beat him to death for contravening the road diversion order on the road scheduled to be inaugurated by Governor Ibikunle Amosun on Monday.

An eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, told newsmen that the TRACE officials had attempted to stop Adoke who was riding a motorcycle around 9am in Oke-Sokori area.

He stated that when apprehended, Adoke had insisted that there was no other route through which he could access his house.

An elderly man, who also pleaded not to be identified, said he was about to plead with the TRACE officials to release the 36-year-old man, when he suddenly slumped and died after being severely beaten by the traffic officials.

It was learnt that the TRACE officials used weapons such as iron rods and other metals on the deceased before he slumped.

The TRACE officials were also said to have immediately fled the area following Adoke’s death.

The deceased was an employee of one of the new generation banks in Abeokuta.

One of the fleeing officials was however later arrested by the police and is currently being held at the Ibara Police Divisional headquarters in Abeokuta.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Muyiwa Adejobi, confirmed the incident.

Similarly, 40 persons, including women, mobile policemen and children were also reported missing as a result of the clash.

Mr Stephen Asuquo, the Chairman of Odukpani Council confirmed the casualties.

But Mr Hogan Bassey, spokesman of the Cross River State Command of the Nigeria Police, who also confirmed that casualties were recorded, said he could not give the exact number of those who lost their lives.

""We cannot give the casualty figures for now because we just discovered another person found dead in the area,"" Bassey said.

The Odukpani Council Chairman said: ""there is no house standing there, the entire village has been destroyed and burnt down.

""I can say it is as a result of the struggle by people from the Ikpanya for the land that belongs to the Ntan Obu-Ukpe and Ikpanya is in Ibiono Local Government Council of Akwa Ibom State, while Ntan Obu is in Odukpani Local Government Area of Cross River State.

""Something akin to this took place a year ago and the deputy governors of the two states met and agreed that everything should return to status quo ante, that was the position before the conflict.

""A Supreme Court judgment has ruled that the land belongs to Odukpani and the people of Odukpani are Cross River indigenes and the people from Ikpanya have tried to lease out Ntan Obu land to cattle rearers to rear their cattles there.

""So I am appealing to the cattle rearers, we don't want cattle rearers being there but you must recognise the overlords and not that of the neighbouring community,"" he said.

The chairman alleged that the attack was not done by the cattle rearers but that indigenes of Ikpanya were the people who attacked Ntan Obu.

""We are yet to ascertain the number because the people they killed, they beheaded and then threw the corpses into the river, the village head was killed and beheaded.

""We could recognise his body from the attire he wore the day before the attack. The name of the village head is Etinyin Mfon Asanye.

""People managed to escape, some jumped through the swamp and jumped into the river. It happened in the wee hours of the morning of Wednesday last week.

""When they got there they set loose all the boats and engine boats that were there to stop the people from escaping and started attacking, it was in the early hours of the morning.

""There was complete destruction of the place, the only two building that are standing are two churches but the churches were looted, the musical instruments were all carted away.

""Some of the displaced persons are in Asan Eniong and nearby villages,"" he said, appealing to government to send security men to the area.

""We are appealing to government to send soldiers and mobile policemen to the area.

""We are appealing that they should use the church building and few of the buildings that were not completely destroyed for the displaced people, while we try to see what we can do to appease them,"" he said.

""The unit commander or the leader of the troop is on ground there and he is doing his best. But before then after the first incident we had a few number of policemen who were there, out of the nine who were there, four are still missing up till now.

""We are suspecting that they may have been murdered and beheaded and we are suspecting that some were dragged to the swamp, we saw some police uniform at the swamp with blood stains,"" he said.

Asuquo called on the Federal Government to act on the judgment of the Supreme Court of June 24, 2005, which demarcated the boundary between Cross River and Akwa Ibom.

""This is to ensure that people from the other side keep to their side and if they are coming here they will come as tenants and they will be welcome and not as invaders,"" he said.

Asakara Ekanem Umo, the Paramount ruler of Odukpani Local Government Area also confirmed the incident.

""The last incursion was so large in destruction. The fight had left the community completely destroyed.

""Children and women were not spared and in the process they killed four mobile police men who were stationed for security assistance to the people over there.

Umo called for provision of relief materials to the affected victims, urging the government to take measures to prevent further occurrence of the mayhem.

It was gathered that members of the security forces who conducted a raid on the building were unaware that the German was being held there but attacked the building based on intelligence report that sect members were hiding there.

A reliable source who witnessed the incident related how it happened. Said he: ""Members of the Sura Council were holding their meeting in a secluded place in Kano. The Sura Council is the highest decision making organ of Boko Haram comprising their operation commanders, thinkers, planners and strategists. Somehow, the security forces including the Joint Task Force got hint that Boko Haram members were meeting there and stormed the place in full force unknown to them that the kidnapped German national was being kept there. There was heavy exchange of fire and when the sect members realised that there was no escape for them they killed the German.

Security sources however explained that six people died during the encounter including the five sect members, a woman, while three soldiers were believed to have sustained injury from a blast that rocked the building during the operations.

Vanguard learnt that the sect members detonated a primed Improvised Explosive Device when the Special Forces stormed their residence.

""Unfortunately, the soldiers stormed the area with over 40 vehicles, including armoured tanks and surrounded the house in the dead of the night.

""There was endless gun duel between our men and the soldiers but none of our men was killed or arrested. They only succeeded in arresting women because our warriors had escaped after killing many security operatives. But the media, which we believed connived with the security agencies and the government, went ahead to publish the opposite which ended up misleading the public.""""However, the military later turned around and said they succeeded in killing one of our members. The fact is if troops would surround our people at night but could not succeed in subduing them even while asleep, how possible is it that they killed four members of our Supreme Council (Shura) in their latest attack as they claimed?

""Is it really true that our leaders were holding meeting? Is it possible for just four members of the high command to sit and take decision? Can members of the high command watch over a foreign hostage whose corpse was found in the area?

'JTF killed civilians'

""One thing that is obvious is that the soldiers had only succeeded in killing over 10 innocent people in the neighborhood. We challenge journalists to go to the area and verify our claims whether our warriors have killed soldiers during the confrontation or not. Why are they (soldiers) hiding away their victims from the press?

""The media should also verify whether the military had extra-judicially killed civilians or not. We are carefully watching what everybody is saying about us. Let everybody, including individuals and groups continue to say whatever they want to say. The obvious fact is that as soon as we complete our preparations and start launching attacks, nobody should persuade us to stop.

Warning for media houses

""This is a special warning to media houses and journalists who are now fond of exaggerating and giving prominence to stories given to them by our enemies even when such press releases and stories given to them are not true.

""It is so unfortunate that the media carries such report word by word without removing or altering anything. But when we issue statements and press releases, the media always look the other way, pretending as if they didn't get the message.

""More worrisome, perhaps, is that even when the media carries the report, they distort what we said just because they want to massage the ego of our enemies.

Demands fair representation

""Henceforth, nobody should talk to us when we attack any media organisation. The least we expect is that if any media organisation is not willing to give us true and fair representation, it is better not to report at all no matter what is said or who said it on the side of the government.

Any media that refuses to adhere to this wise counsel should have itself to blame.

Bauchi church blast scene.

No fewer than 15 people were killed and over 42 seriously injured yesterday after a bomb blast which occurred at the Harvest Field Church of Christ in Yelwa area of Bauchi metropolis in Bauchi State.

Confirming the incident, the chairman of the state emergency operation team, Muhanad Inuwa Bello, told LEADERSHIP that the explosion happened at about 9:15 in the morning.

He said the injured victims were taken to Abubakar Tafawa Ballewa Teaching Hospital (ATBUTH) for medical attention, while the dead bodies had been deposited in the mortuary.

According to him, no one has claimed responsibility, but it is suspected that the suspect died while planting the explosive.

A suicide bomber riding in a Honda Civic car was said to have attempted to force his way into Living Faith Church, Yelwa, hitting a barricade.

The commissioner said: ""A lone suicide bomber in a Honda Civic attempted to force his way into the iron barricade at the entrance of Living Faith Church, Ungwan Angas, Yelwa, Bauchi, but was denied entry.

Recounting the incident in an interview with NAN, a Living Faith Church pastor, Mr. Johnson Elogu, said the suicide bomber forced his car into a group of worshippers.

He said: ""At about 9.20 in the morning when those who attended the first service came out of the church, we heard a blast that shook the entire church building.

""People started running helter-skelter for their lives. I managed to come out only to discover that it was a case of suicide bombing.

""Several persons died while others were seriously injured and had been taken to the hospital.""

Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday asked Nigerians not to despair in the face of the continuing gruesome murder of innocent Nigerians by terrorist groups in bomb attacks like the one launched on a church in Bauchi State.

Presidential spokesman, Dr. Reuben Abati, in a statement quoted the president as appealing to all Nigerians, especially those who occupy leadership positions, to fully support the federal government and security services in the fight against terrorism.

Jonathan said he believed strongly that no patriotic Nigerian should stand aloof while enemies of the nation wage a wicked war against innocent citizens.

The statement made available to LEADERSHIP reads in part: ""President Jonathan conveys sincerest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the bombing and has directed federal medical and emergency services to do everything possible to assist the survivors.

""While the recurrence of a heinous attack on a place of worship is most regrettable, the president urges Nigerians not to be disheartened by it.

""Rather, he urges Nigerians and friends of the country to be comforted by the knowledge that the significant reduction in the frequency of such attacks in recent weeks is a clear indication of the increasing effectiveness of measures that have been put in place by the security services to combat the evil of terrorism.

""President Jonathan assures Nigerians that the armed forces and security services will continue to implement proactive counter-terrorism measures and intensify efforts to totally eradicate the scourge of mindless terrorism from the country.""

In the same vein, the Bauchi State government has condemned the attack on the church, describing it as callous.

Chief press secretary to Governor Isa Yuguda, Mr. Ishola Michael, said such act was not in the best interest of the state and the country.

He said the government received the news of the incident with shock and disbelief, noting that the perpetrators were cowards.

He urged all those with grievances to embrace dialogue, stressing the need for people to embrace peace."

Daily Trust reports that the result of the gun duel was devastating because residents said there was ""mass casualty"" on both sides.

Witnesses said the confrontation, which started on Tuesday with terrifying sound of eight bomb blasts, has left ""unforgettable scars on the civilian population"" in many settlements in the affected areas.

During the ensuing crisis, many people were reportedly killed, houses, shops and vehicles vandalized and freedom of movement curtailed.

Residents said they could only compare the incident of the last two days with what transpired in July 2009, when federal troops had days of intense battle with followers of Mohammed Yusuf, the leader of the sect, who was also killed during the crisis.

""Members of the Yusufiyya movement came out in large number, over 40 of them. They looked fearless and ready to die. They launched the first assault on JTF operatives around 4.30pm at Lawan Bukar area on Tuesday,"" a witness in the area, who saw how the trouble started, said.

Our correspondents report that the offensive by the suspected gunmen marked the beginning of the ravaging battle which prompted soldiers to cordon off all the roads and alleys leading to the red spots, including the palace of the Shehu of Borno.

Findings revealed that the complete blockage of the areas lasted till around 11am yesterday.

Though the JTF had at a press conference yesterday declared that 15 suspected members of the Boko Haram were killed during the operation, and that there were no civilian casualties, residents of Abbaganaram, Gwange, State Low Cost, Lamisula, Kula Gumna, Hausari, Tashar Gwoza and Lawan Bukar areas said more than 30 civilians were killed and many others injured.

""While peeping out from the window of my room, I saw five military men in uniform on the ground,"" Mohammed Ali Gana, a resident of Budun said. ""I also saw when some pick up vehicles took away some soldiers with blood stains around 9pm yesterday (Tuesday), he said.

Daily Trust investigation revealed that already, all the areas affected by the clampdown have recorded an exodus of people, many of them going away with their personal effects such as mattresses, cooking utensils and even domestic animals.

""It is painful we have to leave our houses this morning (yesterday) because we survived last night true the special grace of Allah,"" Halima Adama, a mother of four said. She said her husband said he was not willing to go.

""He said he rather die than to leave the house he built with his sweat...I have to leave with my children because I don't want them to be killed,"" she said. She said she was on her way to Mallam Fatori, a border town between Nigeria and Niger.

Journalists did not have the opportunity to go deep into the crisis-riddled settlements because up till the time of filing this report, fierce looking soldiers, SSS, police and other security agencies were still closely guarding the areas.

Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, the Field Operations officer of the JTF, said during the press conference that only one soldier was injured during the fight. He acknowledged that this is the first time in recent months that suspected members of the Boko Haram attempted to confront the JTF. He debunked claims by residents that the military had suffered heavy casualty while many civilians were killed and others wounded."

One of the explosions was at the Borno State Police headquarters where a suicide bomber made a dash on it and got six persons killed including two policemen and four civilians.

A police source said the suicide car bomber believed to be a member of the dreaded Boko Haram sect attempted to force his way into the headquarters through the main gate with a car laden with explosives.

The source said the bomb went off while policemen on guard at the gate prevented the bomber from entering.

He however said he could not give further details as ""efforts are going on to clear the debris and rescue the affected persons.""

Yesterday's attack is the second time a suicide bomber would aim at the police headquarters. The first attempt was made last year August.

During yesterday's attack, though the bomber was gun down by the policemen at the gate, the bomb still went off.

In the second explosion, which happened earlier between 7:00 am and 8:15 am, an unknown bomber got detonated around 'Gidan Dambe' area of the metropolis.

According to witnesses, he was trying to plant an Improvised Explosive Device, which exploded and left him dead.

It was gathered that movement of some suspicious persons had started at Gidan Dambe on Thursday night but that the people of the area kept mute for fear of being killed.

According to the source, they saw men carrying weapons around Gidan Dambe but they concluded that they might be security operative in plain clothes.

The town had been experiencing clashes between sect members and security operatives. The sources however said they noticed some awkward behaviour in the people and suspected them to be members of dreaded Boko Haram sect.

JTF, who later spoke to newsmen said that the IED was concealed in a bag and kept under a public shed and exploded while the victim was trying to plant it.

As at the time of filing this story yesterday evening at about 4pm the entire town was deserted with most part of the major roads cordoned off."

Smoke billows from the protest that followed yesterday's bomb attack at St Finbarr's Parish Rayfield, a Catholic church in Jos.

Jos — Gunmen, yesterday, attacked two churches in Jos and Biu town in Borno State, killing five people and injuring several others.

In Jos, a suicide bomb attack on a church left the suicide bomber and two others dead.

Several others have been hospitalised at the Plateau Specialist Hospital and Bingham University Teaching Hospital as a result of injuries from the blast. Others had gunshot wounds.

A yet to be ascertained number were also lynched by an irate mob protesting the bomb attack at Christ Chosen Church located along Rukuba Road.

The suicide bomber, according to eye witnesses, drove a Volkswagen Vento car with number plate Bauchi AJ413BAU into the church premises at about 11a.m and rushed out of the car shortly after which there was a huge explosion which brought down the church building.

It was learnt that nobody died in the church as a result of the blast because only a few people who stayed back for a meeting were still in the church at the time of the incident.

The bomber was said to have diverted to the church which is not fenced after attempts to gain entry into some of the bigger churches in the area failed because of the security barricades in place.

It was alleged that like what happened during the attack on the COCIN Headquarters Church, the suicide bomber drove closely behind a military van before turning off the Rukuba Barracks Road into the church which is several metres away from the major road.

Reprisal attack

Following the blast, irate youths took over the road attacking commercial motorcyclists and others in apparent reprisals. Unconfirmed report said at least seven people were said to have been killed in such attacks.

However, our correspondent sighted about four charred bodies of those believed to have been victims of reprisals in different places. The irate mob harassed security men and journalists preventing them from going to the venue.

The windshield of the NTA crew which was heading for the scene was smashed as the mob expressed anti-government and anti-security forces sentiments.

The state Police Commissioner, Mr. Emmanuel Ayeni, while confirming the incident said only the suicide bomber died at the church while the two others died from the riot that broke out in the aftermath of the blast. The suicide bomber was said to have been torn apart by the blast.

He said four vehicles and a motorcycle were damaged in the blast but regretted that the reaction by angry youth slowed down rescue operations.

It's saddening -Plateau govt

The Plateau State government has, meanwhile, described the blast as saddening despite efforts put in place to prevent such attacks.

It said the incident coming after a period of calm in the state was an indication that the security measures put in place were working and appealed to the people to remain calm and not to do anything capable of heightening the tension.

The Commissioner for Information, Mr. Abraham Yiljap, spoke on behalf of the state government.

The police commissioner confirmed that 41 people were injured.

Contrary to initial claims, some of the church members receiving treatment at the Bingham University Teaching Hospital told journalists that they had just finished prayers and the sermon was about to commence when the car drove into the premises at top speed and rammed into one of the pillars.

Three churches were attacked this morning by suicide bombers in Kaduna. One went off at the Evangelical Church of West Africa (ECWA) church, Wusasa and another at the Christ the King Cathedral Catholic church at No. 80, Yoruba Street, Sabon Gari, Zaria, just behind the Army Depot, Zaria where all Nigerian soldiers receive their basic training.

The explosions sparked violence in Kaduna as christian youths retaliated, moving around with cutlasses and sticks among other weapons. Sources say the youths burnt a mosque at Television area and another at Gonin Gora was broken into and vandalised in retaliation for the attacks on the three churches.

Men of Operation Yaki are said to have taken charge of the situation, especially around Goningora which is along the Abuja-Kaduna expressway and where Christian youths were beginning to get violent.

Kaduna — Daily Trust has confirmed that at least 23 people lost their lives in the bomb attacks on three churches in Kaduna this morning. These figures are from the three main hospitals where victims were taken to and does not include those taken to other private hospitals.

In addition, about 11 others have been killed in reprisal attacks across the town.

According to Dr. Taylor Adeyemi, the acting Chief Medical Director of St. Luke's hospital in Wusasa, 40 victims, mostly children were brought into their hospital following the blast at ECWA in Wusasa. Of this number, three were dead on arrival.

From the blast at the Christ the King Cathedral at No. 80 Yoruba street Daily Trust confirmed 10 dead and over 50 injured.

Also, Dr. Lawal Khalid, the Chief Medical Director of ABU Teaching Hospital has confirmed to Daily Trust that the hospital received nine victims dead on arrival and is treating 31 others. One of the wounded died while receiving treatment, bringing the death toll at ABUTH to 10. These are also from the blasts at Wusasa and Zaria, he said. He also said those receiving treatment at the hospital are all in stable condition.

Meanwhile, the Kaduna state government has imposed a 24-hour curfew to bring the volatile situation under control. Thousands are trapped in different places of worship in the city and cannot go home due to the curfew order.

Three churches were attacked this morning by suicide bombers in Kaduna. One went off at the Evangelical Church of West Africa (ECWA) church, Wusasa and another at the Christ the King Cathedral Catholic church at No. 80, Yoruba Street, Sabon Gari, Zaria, just behind the Army Depot, Zaria where all Nigerian soldiers receive their basic training. The third church, Shalom Church at Trikania close to Abuja Fly over and Textile Labour house, was hit by multiple explosions around 10:17am.

Also, about 35 victims of the reprisal attacks that followed the bombing have been taken to St. Gerard's Hospital within the metropolis according to the hospitals public relations officer. Seven of them were dead on arrival, burnt by their presumed assailants.

The explosions sparked violence in Kaduna as christian youths retaliated, moving around with cutlasses and sticks among other weapons. Sources say the youths burnt a mosque at Television area and another at Gonin Gora was broken into and vandalised in retaliation for the attacks on the three churches.

Men of Operation Yaki are said to have taken charge of the situation, especially around Goningora which is along the Abuja-Kaduna expressway and where Christian youths were beginning to get violent. An eyewitness told Daily Trust he saw four dead bodies near the Goningora mosque. Other trouble spots so far identified are Sabon Tasha, Trikania, Television area and Unguwan Romi.

""Everything is being done to bring the situation to a stop by denying those bent on causing anarchy in the state the opportunity to celebrate their objectives. Government regret this decisive decision, but it has been done in the interest of the state in order to avoid the loss of lives and property in the state again.

Students of Kaduna State Technical College going home due to the 24 hours curfew imposed on Kaduna on Wednesday.

Kaduna — Heavy fighting, killings and burning of property continued, yesterday, in Hausa/Fulani dominated parts of Kaduna, as the minority non-Muslims in the areas tried to fight back despite the 24-hour curfew imposed over the entire state. This came as Pope Benedict XVI has appealed to those responsible for the violence to stop spilling innocent blood.

As the battle raged, trapped residents who were unable to leave their homes as a result of the 24-hour curfew imposed by the government have cried out saying they were running out of food, medicine and water.

Meanwhile, worried by the spate of killings and destruction, the Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Olusheyin Petinrin and the Acting Inspector General of Police, M D Abubakar held a closed-door meeting with Governor Patrick Yakowa on how to bring normalcy to the state.

The violence was in retaliation to mass killings of Hausa Muslims and the destruction of their property by Christian youths in Kaduna after Islamist militants bombed two churches in Zaria and one in Kaduna last Sunday, killing 17 and injuring several others.

In Bardarawa, north of Kaduna town,fighting raged between Muslims and non-Muslims around 4pm yesterday.

There were reports of killings and burning of homes of mainly non Hausas, but it was also said that youths in some parts of the area, were retaliating.

Meanwhile, casualty continued to rise at the time of this report from findings by Vanguard.

Pope urges end to attacks on Christians in Nigeria

Pope Benedict in his reaction, yesterday, called for immediate end to what he called ""terrorist attacks""against Christians in Nigeria and urged all sides to avoid reprisals.

The pope at his weekly general audience said, ""I am following with deep concern the news from Nigeria, where terrorist attacks are continuing especially against Christians. I appeal to those responsible for the violence to immediately stop the spilling of the blood of many innocent people.""

He urged all groups in Nigeria to shun ""the path of vendetta""and work towards building a peaceful society where people were free to practise their religion.

Hospitals receive more corpses, injured persons

At the St. Gerald Catholic Hospital, the Public Relations Officer of the Hospital, Mr Sunday John confirmed to Vanguard that five corpses were deposited, yesterday, with 14 injured persons, as a result of the fresh violence.

At the Barau Dikko General Hospital, an unspecified number of dead bodies were taken there with many other injured persons.

It was also gathered that some other private hospitals were treating many injured victims.

Another source told Vanguard, that a car conveying four traders to their business premises on Jos Road, off Bayajida Street, was burnt with all the occupants of the car, inside,Tuesday.

""Their bodies are still inside the burnt car"", said the source who asked not to be mentioned.

In Barnawa part of the town, it was reported that some trucks and buses were brought to evacuate many women and children since the violence broke out last Sunday.

A source at Barnawa, told Vanguard in his home, that some arms and ammunition were recovered in a mosque along Unguwan Barde, on Aliyu Makama Road.

""When the youths stormed the Holy Family Catholic Church last Tuesday evening, we knew that they would not have the guts if they did not have something to fall back to. We organised ourselves and chased them with sticks and stones. Soon the loudspeaker in the mosque started calling for prayers at that odd time. The man calling for the prayers even said that they should come ready to fight. It was at this point that we informed the soldiers and they came into the mosque and arrested three persons with arms and ammunition"", he said.

""We have been told reliably that they have brought in their fighters. We have not slept since last Monday evening, keeping watch over them"", he added.

At far away Kawo, it was reported that youths were said to have hijacked vehicles, killing travelers.

At Hiyin Banki, many were reported killed, while Christian youths had also responded by killing and burning some Hausa Muslims and their property.

Curiously however, the areas south of Kaduna River were calm yesterday.

But a source, told Vanguard that some of the youths had sneaked out to join in the fight North of the river.

Major streets in Kaduna were deserted, shops and offices were shut while schools and business areas were closed.

40 persons killed in Damaturu

Also in Damaturu, Yobe state capital where a 24-hour curfew has also been imposed, 34 civilians, four policemen and two soldiers were said to have been killed according to the state police commissioner, Mr Patrick Egbuniwe.

The city was deserted Wednesday after the government imposed a 24-hour curfew that left residents trapped wherever they were when violence erupted.

After being trapped for two days, residents said they were running out of food, medicine and water.

Abdul Malik, a 41-year-old father of two, said his family has stopped taking baths so they can have more water to drink.

""We should be giving the children antibiotics but we are just boiling the water, especially for the baby,"" he said.

Malik said he felt fortunate, however, that he had already returned home when the first blasts went off.

Isa Ahmed Dori, 39, said he was separated from his wife and child because he had gone to visit a friend. He has since learnt that his father-in-law died in the violence.

""I am in a dilemma,"" he said on the phone. ""I don't know how my family is faring.""

An auto mechanic in the restive city said he has not been home since the fighting started.

""I have been in my workshop since Monday,"" Gambo Bakanike told AFP. ""We have an open well from which we can get our drinking water, but we have run out of food.""

A senior hospital official said he and his staff have also been stranded since Monday.

""There is water but we don't have any food. Our families can't bring us anything because of the curfew,"" said the official who asked to remain anonymous."

In Lokoja, capital of Kogi State, the police command has discovered a hideout in Koto - Karfe area of the state where guns were being locally manufactured.

In Kano State, the Joint Military Taskforce, JTF, also yesterday discovered a high calibre Improvised Explosive Devise, IED, in the premises of Waje Friday Jumat Mosque in Fagge Local Government Area of the state. The JTF also arrested four persons while allegedly trying to plant the bomb in the mosque.

This was even as there was pandemonium in the Zone 5 area of Abuja, yesterday evening, following a bomb scare, with some offices in the ever-busy environment quickly evacuating as business men and women also hurriedly closed shops and residents scampered for safety.

Policemen from bomb disposal unit packing defused home made bombs made from cans of soft drinks.

In Minna, Niger State capital and environs, business activities were also temporarily disrupted yesterday afternoon as rumour of attacks by members of an Islamic sect, Boko-Haram filtered into town. The rumour which started barely an hour to the Friday Juma'at Mosque climaxed as some shop owners closed shops for the day's business while many traders at the Kure ultra modern market and other markets around the metropolis also hurriedly followed suit.

However, six other people were injured in Plateau State when the assailants suspected to be Fulani herdsmen and said to have numbered over 30 stormed the village at about 3.30am wielding guns and machetes.

An eyewitness said the attackers killed six members of the Dakibang family in their sleep and injured two other members of the family who were hit with machetes as they tried to escape before moving to other houses in the village where they injured four other people.

They reportedly shot sporadically while some of them attacked those trying to escape with dangerous weapons and operated for about two hours before escaping through a bush path.

Security men to whom distress calls were made allegedly arrived at the village an hour after the attackers had gone.

Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Mr. John Clark Dabwang who visited the affected village to commiserate with them described the attack as barbaric and wicked.

He wondered why people would hack down fellow human beings in cold blood and appealed for calm among the people urging them not to carry out reprisals.

Spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, Deputy Superintendent Emmanuel Abuh confirmed the attack and the six killed adding that investigations were on to track down the perpetrators.In Kano State, the Waje Friday Mosque lies within the expanse of land that separate the predominantly Christian quarters and the indigenous Hausa.

Bomb found in Kano mosque

A statement by JTF spokesman made available to Saturday Vanguard in Kano, Lt Ikediche Iweha stated:

""The attention of the general public is hereby drawn to the latest desperate and despicable tactics employed by members of the terrorist sect aimed at causing public disorder and riots in the name of religion. This afternoon, June 22, 2012, at about 2pm, the attention of the JTF was called by a careful Nigerian to a suspicious package at a mosque in Fagge area just before the Friday prayers. Upon examination, the package turned out to be an IED planted by terrorists to cause death and grievous harm to worshippers at the Jum'mat prayers.

""This latest attempt is particularly disturbing in view of the wider implication it would have had on the fragile peace in Kano and the disruption of economic activities it would have brought with it. It is also equally disturbing in view of the recent events in parts of Kaduna State to which Kano boarders.""

Similarly, the Police Public Relation Officer in the state, DSP Rilwanu Tanimu confirmed the arrest of the four suspects stressing that they were apprehended after they abandoned the IED stocked in a polythene bag.

Taminu further explained that a comprehensive investigation has begun on the matter, adding that the four suspects were in their custody.

Bomb scare in Abuja

As usual with such situations, there were several versions to the cause of the scare with some people saying that a bag dropped from a moving vehicle and those by the road side took to their heels.

Another version had it that a bag was dropped near an eatery in the area where several government offices, and private businesses as well as, the ruling Peoples' Democratic Party, PDP, had their headquarters.

Some eyewitnesses said they saw a suspicious bag between Top View Hotel and the headquarters of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps office in the area and concluded that it could be an explosive.

The headquarters of the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, is located on the other side of the road leading to Alvan Ikoku Way. The incident which occurred between about 3pm and 5 pm caused traffic gridlock in the area as one lane had to be closed to traffic.

However, when Anti-Bomb Policemen visited the place, it was confirmed that there no explosive in the said bag.

Locally manufactured arms

The Kogi State police Commissioner, Muhammed Katsina who briefed newsmen over the incident said three persons, (names withheld), were arrested at the factory where locally made guns were being manufactured.

Katsina said, the trio who had already confessed to have manufactured guns of different categories for men of the underworld were arrested by detectives who swooped on them at their workshop following a tip off.

According to Katsina, 10 locally made single- barreled guns, one locally made double barreled gun, two manufacturing machines and a gas cylinder were recovered at the ""arms workshop.""

He further said the state command also arrested two persons, aged 25 and 26 in connection with the kidnapping of a teenage girl, Racheal Bulus from Jos.

The girl who was a Face book friend of Haruna travelled to see him only for the two to detain her and call her father asking for N200,000 ransom. The duo according to the police boss were arrested while trying to withdraw the money from their bank account in Ogane Iyale, Dekina Local Government of the state

Traders scamper in Minna over rumour of attack

As a result of the rumour of attack, the Friday prayer Mosques which were usually filled to capacity with adherents of the Islamic faith was poorly attended as many moslems chose to stay indoors as part of the rumour indicated that the central mosque was the target of the sect.

Proprietors of private schools, especially those owned by Christians, who were in session,out of fear called or sent text messages to parents/guardians to come for their wards as their fears were further heightened by the presence of soldiers and anti-riot policemen who were patrolling the town.The situation was chaotic as parents who had their wards in schools drove recklessly to pick their children, in the process, causing traffic gridlock along major roads in the city, especially at the Central Mosque-Sabon-Gari round- about linking the Obasanjo shopping complex.

Taxis and commercial motorcycle drivers popularly called 'Okada' were not left out in the confusion that ensued. While many simply stopped business to watch the unfolding events, others made brisk business charging more than the normal cost for a drop.

Meanwhile, the police in Niger state have advised residents against spreading rumour over possible attacks and asked them to go about their normal businesses.

A statement signed by the Police Public Relation Officer, PPRO,, Pius Edobor, solicited the support and cooperation of Nigerlites in tackling security challenges by providing the police with useful information to check criminals and people from cause breach of the peace.

Edobor described the rumoured attack as one of the gimmicks by mischief makers and assured residents of the state of their safety at all times.

Conflict in Nigeria.

Tragedy stuck yesterday night in Bolori Ward of Maiduguri Metropolitan council (MMC) when about 14 people, including some factory workers who were working at the Maiduguri Central Mosque opposite the Palace of the Shehu of Borno, which is under construction, were killed by unidentified men.

According to sources within the area, the attackers who numbered about 30 persons came to their compound which is popularly known as 'Civilian barrack' around 12:30am with dangerous weapons before embarking on room-to-room killings, robbed the victims of their belongings such as money, handsets and electronics.

When our correspondent visited the area yesterday, the whole place was deserted except members of the Joint Task Force {JTF] which had already cordoned off the area, as most of the victims were non-natives, mostly from Adamawa State.

A witness told LEADERSHIP that she saw one of the victims crying and begging the hoodlums not to kill him, as he was prepared to give them any amount of money they wanted, but the hit-men still killed him even after collecting his money.

""It was a shock to see a human being been slaughtered like an animal,"" she said."

More than 86 people including two lawmakers were killed in the mayhem, even as there were fresh attacks on two villages yesterday.

The Islamic sect in a statement purportedly issued by its spokesman, Abu Qaqa claiming responsibility for the killings said: ""Jama'atu Ahlissunnah Lidda'awati Wal-Jihad wants to inform the world of its delight over the success of the attacks we launched on Barkin Ladi and Riyom in Plateau State on Christians and security operatives, including members of the National Assembly. We will continue to hunt government officials wherever they are; they will have no peace again.""

Disputing Boko Haram's claim, however, a police source in Plateau who requested anonymity told AFP that if Boko Haram were involved, it would be because the Fulani invited them to take part. Suspected Fulani were the ones that carried out that attack. That is the opinion of the police"". The source specified that the Fulani herdsmen were responsible for both the Saturday and Sunday violence.

A member of the House of Representatives representing Jos South and Jos East Federal Constituency, Bitrus Kaze said that foreign mercenaries were responsible for the attacks in some communities last weekend. The federal lawmaker who was a guest on Channels Television's Sunrise Daily programme said that these mercenaries some of who are from Chad have stayed in the Fulani community in Plateau State for about two years.

Two more villages attacked

Meanwhile, two more villages in Barkin-Ladi Local Government Area have been attacked by gunmen who reduced them to rubble. The attack was confirmed yesterday by member representing Riyom Constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Mr. Daniel Dem who gave the names of the villages as Tse and Shong.

""I can authoritatively confirm to you that as I am talking to you now, the same gunmen from top of the mountains have attacked two more villages. The two villages, Tse and Shong have been reduced to ruin with no house standing. The gunmen came in their usual style with sporadic shooting.

""The villagers were scared and they ran out of their houses and the gunmen set the houses ablaze rendering them homeless and increasing the number of displaced people"", he said.

He said about 140 corpses were strewn all over the area now because people are afraid to go and pick them up for burial since Sunday's attack on the burial procession.

The Plateau State Government has, however, relaxed the curfew imposed in four local government areas of the state by five hours. It announced after a State Security Council meeting on Tuesday that the curfew would now be from 6pm to 7am.

Lawmaker flays emergency rule in four LGAs

Still smarting from his miraculous escape in an attack that took away two other law makers, member representing Barkin-Ladi/Riyom Constituency in the House of Representatives, Mr. Simon Mwadkon has said that there had been more killings and destruction since President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency on four local government areas of the state, saying it is time to review the declaration.

""It is time to review the security situation, especially the state of emergency because it has achieved nothing. If anything, there has been more killings, more destruction of farmlands during this period than any other. Everybody has been pushed to the wall and I am tired of telling the people to be calm. People must defend themselves"", he said.

He told journalists yesterday that the attacks on his constituents by the Fulani is a continuation of the 'jihad' which started since 1804 to forcefully Islamize minority tribes in the Northern part of the country, adding that his people were regretting their hospitality to the Fulani.

He also expressed the desire of the Fulani to acquire more land for grazing as another reason adding that they are always seeking ways of gaining more grounds.

Reacting to statements credited to an official of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, Mallam Saleh Bayari that the Fulani were retaliating attacks on them in past crises in the state during which they lost several lives and property, Mwadkon said there was no truth in the claim.

""It had been the agenda of the Fulani since the jihad of Usman Dan Fodio, who proclaimed that for the whole North to be Islamized, all the Northern minorities must be conquered. It has been the agenda since 1804 when the jihadists failed to capture the Middle belt region, which they want to use as a launching pad to capture the south. It is their belief that once the Northern minorities were captured, they will be willing tools for the capture of the South.

""Another reason is the quest for grazing reserves and that was why the House of Representatives killed the bill on grazing reserves because it has caused a lot of havoc in the country. I don't know why they are saying that they lost property in 2001 because the 2001 crisis only ended in Riyom. It never got to Gashish (the area attacked last Saturday).

""And talking about their destroyed villages, I don't know how many villages they have because you know these people are not indigenes. They don't have any village. All the places they settled, they bought from the natives and paid royalties. It's just that after a time, we felt that they have integrated enough and allowed them and this we regret till today"", he said.

Mwadkon had on Monday accused some men of the Special Task Force maintaining security in the state of complicity in the attacks on his people, adding that there was an Al-Queda base within some farmlands in Riyom Local Government Area which needed to be uprooted.

STF confirms 86 killed

Meantime, the Special Task Force (STF) in charge of security in Plateau State has given the number of those killed in last weekend's violence in the state as 86 made up of the two lawmakers, 63 villagers and 21 of the attackers.

STF's spokesman, Captain Salisu Mustapha confirmed to journalists yesterday that two anti-riot policemen were also killed in the attack but said no other person died in the attack on the funeral procession on Sunday apart from the two lawmakers.

He denied reports that soldiers ran away from the scene following the attack on the funeral procession at Matse, adding that what happened was that the commanding officer ordered those present to lie down flat when the shooting started but rather than heed his instruction, the people started running leading to a stampede.

His clarification has, however, not doused allegations of complicity of some military men in the attacks on the villages as both Governor Jonah Jang and member representing Barkin-Ladi/Riyom federal constituency, Mr. Simon Mwadkon re-echoed this at different fora, yesterday.

Jang while receiving Governor Gabriel Suswam of Benue State who led a delegation on sympathy visit to his Plateau State counterpart said it was clear that there were ""enemies within"".

According to him, ""something must definitely be wrong. I have seen it and some of you have seen it that there is a lot of collusion even within the security forces. A lot of the members of Boko Haram and others are also part of the security men that are wearing uniforms today.

""Even when you plan operations, before you carry out the operations, the enemies have already known. Having been part of the military forces, it is a very dangerous thing to have enemy within, it is the most dangerous enemy you can ever have.""

Mwadkon had levelled similar allegation, noting that the manner of attack on the funeral precession at Matse on Sunday was suspicious.

""Before the attack, a member of the STF asked us to relocate the ambulance we brought to the village on the premise that he wants to bring in an armoured tank. We complied without wasting time, only for him to bring in a Hi-lux vehicle to block the only access road leading to the village.

""The next thing we heard was a signal shot which was later followed by the appearance of gunmen from the nearby hills. The entire military men within the vicinity took to their heels leaving behind a police man who piloted us. We could not escape because the only narrow road to the area had been blocked by the Hi-lux vehicle.

""While we were running, there was a gunshot that disorganized us and many of us fell down. The Majority Leader, Plateau State House of Assembly, Hon. Gyang Fulani and Senator Dantong were unconscious and put in separate vans. But to my surprise one hour after I got to the hospital, the two vans which left before me had not arrived. When Hon. Fulani was brought he died in my presence while Dantong was brought dead to the hospital. So something is wrong somewhere,"" he said.

Suswam had during the condolence visit to Jang described the death of a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the manner Dantong died as a national disgrace advising that it should not be seen as a Plateau problem but one which every patriotic Nigerian must come together to find a solution.

He said: ""This has become a recurring decimal in Plateau. I believe that as leaders, we must together, find a solution to this. It is not a Plateau problem, this is a Nigerian problem. This incident is of course a shame to the entire nation that a distinguished senator of the Federal Republic and a member of the House could die in an incident such as this.

""This is unfortunate and this must attract the concern of all well-meaning Nigerians. I believe also as leaders, we should not stand by and watch this drift into an irreversible crisis in this country.

""It is difficult for people who have lost their loved ones to take this easily except we as leaders live up to our responsibilities,"" he said.

The Senator representing Plateau North Dr Gyang Dantong and Majority Leader of Plateau House of Assembly Hon. Gyang Fulani were killed on Sunday while attending the mass burial of villagers killed on Saturday by suspected Fulani herdsmen.

The Pam Ayuba, spokesman for the Plateau state's governor confirming the incident said the senator representing Plateau north, Gyang Dantong, and the majority leader of the state assembly, Gyang Fulani and others were gunned down today Sunday by Fulani herdsmen,""

He added that the two were killed shortly after attending the mass burial for the victims of a Saturday raid, also blamed on the Fulani, a tribe made up of Muslim herdsmen.

After the burial, the officials went to a reception at the home of another local leader in the state's Gashis district, roughly 90 kilometres (56 miles) from the capital Jos, Ayuba said.

""The Fulani herdsmen raided the house...they shot (the politicians) and some others but the key people who lost their lives are the senator and the majority leader,"" he explained, saying he did not know the total number of casualties.

Another federal lawmaker ""escaped death by a whisker,"" he added.

Asked about the motivation for the attacks, Ayuba said the Fulani were likely inspired by their resentment for the state's Christian political leadership.

Bomb blast scene in Maiduguri (file photo)

Maiduguri and Abuja — A 15-year-old suicide bomber yesterday afternoon attacked the central mosque in Maiduguri, Borno State, killing five people.

The deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Zanna Umar Mustapha and the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Ibn Abubakar Umar Garbai Elkanemi were in the mosque during the attack but narrowly escaped death.

Some worshippers who spoke anonymously said they were about leaving the mosque after the Friday prayer when the attack occurred. The mosque often have in attendance the Shehu of Borno and prominent personalities on Fridays.

According to sources, yesterday service was not an exemption as both the Shehu and the deputy governor were among the other notable persons in attendance.

It was gathered that the suicide bomber lurched into the crowd of worshippers but was prevented from getting to the Shehu and the deputy governor by security men attached to the two men.

The subsequent explosion, sources said, led to his death and that of four others.

""The deputy governor and the Shehu were whisked away by their security details. The entire placed was immediately cordoned off by security men and vehicles diverted from the entire vicinity,"" said an eyewitness.

Confirming the incident, the Field Operations Officer of the Joint Task Force in Borno State, Victor Ebhaleme said the blast led to the death of five people.

He did not rule out the possibility of the deputy governor and the Shehu of Borno being the targets of the suicide bomber. Ebhaleme said it was fortunate enough that the suicide bomber could not get access to them before the explosion went up.

He said: "" Five persons have been confirmed dead while six others sustained injury as a result of the bomb blast

Also confirming the incident in a press release, the spokesman of the JTF, Lt. Col. Sagir Musa said: ""At about 1410 hours a suicide bomber strapped with explosives detonated bombs very close to the Shehu of Borno and the deputy governor of Borno State and their entourage immediately after the Juma'at prayer.

""The JTF troops attached to the Shehu's palace prevented the bomber from getting to the Shehu and the deputy governor.""

Musa further revealed that two soldiers that prevented the Shehu and deputy governor from being consumed were critically injured.

He said the area was immediately cordoned off and swept by the bomb disposal arm of the task force.

The deputy governor, later in an interview at the government house after the blast said: ""I am alive. The Shehu of Borno is also alive; we give thanks to Allah because I thought I had lost my legs due to bloodstains on my cloth but as you can see nothing happened to any of us.

""The suicide bomber was a very young boy that came almost between myself and the Shehu of Borno.""

Meanwhile, President of the Senate, David Mark has condemned the bombing attack on the Shehu of Borno.

Mark, who described the act as ""callous"", said attacks on places of worship are not only ungodly but ""a huge sacrilege.""

According to him, ""the attack on the Shehu's Mosque has shown that Boko Haram in itself is not helping to propagate Islam contrary to the messages that had been churned out by the sect.""

The Senate President commiserated with the government and people of Borno State and advised Nigerians to be security conscious.

He urged Nigerians to continue to provide information that would quell the activities of the Boko Haram sect to security agencies even as he called on those responsible for these murderous acts to have a rethink and accept dialogue."

By Onoja Audu Reporter, Jos

Following Friday’s renewed gun attack which claimed three lives on Ramadan eve in Kano after weeks of “cease fire,” security has again heightened in the commercial town.

The attack, which police said was executed by gun men on motorcycles, coincided with the state government’s relaxation of the six-month-old movement restriction order clamped on commercial motor bike operatives following gun attacks during the January 20 multiple bombing of the city that claimed several lives.

The rampant attacks in remote areas of the capital were allegedly carried out by gun men on motor bikes hence the sanctioning of bike operation on the streets beyond 6pm.

With the new directive outlawing the previous order, announced by Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso on Friday, motor cyclists in Kano can now operate up to 8pm. The governor described the action as being in the spirit of the Ramadan.

Kano police spokesman, Mohammed Dutse, said the gun men on a bike opened fire on a group of card-playing young men, killing two on the spot while the third died on the way to the Murtala Mohammed hospital.

Dutse said the attack occurred at Kwanar Radio Freedom in Sharada, a Kano suburb, and that no arrest has so far been made. According to him, police received a distress call from some residents in the neighbourhood and rushed to the scene.

Huge presence of security personnel was witnessed on Saturday in different parts of the city, while mosques, especially the high profile ones, have been fortified by a combine team of police and soldiers. The state special anti-terrorism squad, the joint task force (JTF), are reportedly combing nooks crannies of the in search of the extremists.

Kano State Commissioner of Police, Ibrahim Idris, said the command is liaising with paramilitary services in the state to contribute personnel towards strengthening security in the state during the Ramadan period, he said the command intends to also engage the services of the hisbah guards, the state shariah agency to beef up security in remote parts of the city, especially places of Muslim worship during the fasting period.

“We can reveal how many men we are committing to beef-up security in the state during this period for security reasons, but we assure you we are not leaving anything to chance. “The hisbah and the police will jointly man high profile mosques throughout the fasting period. Already, personnnel have been moved around places of worship,” The city has witnessed relative peace for some time now, owing to improved security put together by security operatives especially the joint task force and police.

Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) chairman in Kano, Bishop Ramon 8ello, while acknowledging the development, attributed it to prayers by Christians and Muslims and improved security. “We can feel the peace from the improved church service lately and it demonstrates the fact the people’s confidence in the security operatives is being restored. We’ll continue to seek divine intervention in the nation’s security issue.

Going by the palpable tension in Bokkos Local Government Area of Plateau State, a free-for-all may break out between the native tribes of the area over the constant raids on villagers by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.

This indication was given at the weekend in Jos by the Chairman of the Council, Zaka Akoos, who warned over incessant attacks against several villages in his locality .

According to him, three villages were attacked during which one person was killed. He lamented that, what the state government is doing notwithstanding,’’people still have the heart to attack others.”

He wondered how people can, in the dead of the night, hack a fellow human being to death. He said his people cannot run away and leave their land for the assailants.

Mahanga Fulani settlement in Riyom Local Government Area of Plateau State still remains a no-go area for civilians despite the return order from the Military High Command in Abuja that the refuges should return to their homes in the restive Council of the state.

The settlement, Sunday Independent gathered, was where foreign mercenaries lodged before carrying out their attacks of Riyom villages.

The Special Task Force (STF) on the Jos crisis in a statement said both Berom natives and Fulanis can now go back to their home except Mahanga village.

It will be recalled that, last week, both the Berom villagers in the affected six communities were ejected from their homes by the STF preparatory to an operation to flush out suspected terrorists who have been causing mayhem in the area.

STF spokesman, Captain Salisu Mustapher, said out of the five villages that were evacuated only Mahanga remains a no-going area. He said military operation is still on going there.

Six people including three civilians, the emir's police orderly and two other policemen sustained various degrees of injuries while the suicide bomber died in the incident, Yobe State police commissioner Mr. Patrick Egbuniwe said.

""The suicide bomber laced his body with explosives but some did not explode. It was after the attack that our men from the bomb disposal unit went and de-mobilized the remaining explosives,"" the commissioner said.

The attack on the Yobe Monarch, who is Chairman of Yobe State Council of Chiefs, came three weeks after a similar one on the Shehu of Borno Alhaji Abubakar Umar Garbai Al-Amin El-Kanemi.

The Jama'atuAhlis Sunnah Lidda'awati Wal Jihad, also known as Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the suicide mission on the emir.

Spokesman of the group, Abul Qaqa, who stated this on phone equally claimed responsibility for the attack launched in Rigasa, Kaduna State. ""Our attacks will continue unabated. We would continue killing politicians, security personnel, Christians and anybody who assists security men to arrest us,"" he said.

Witnesses said if not for the ""share bravado of the police orderly,"" the emir would have been killed.

""The effect of the blast severed one of the hands of the orderly while trying to shield the emir. Most of the people around the scene thought the orderly had died because blood was gushing out from the severed hand,"" Salis Idi, a worshipper at the central mosque, who saw what happened, said.

""The emir was not injured but at least 20 people have sustained injuries, some grievous. The scene was filled to capacity because many were trooping out of the mosque, some trying to have a glimpse of the emir.

""Soon after the dust that enveloped the sky faded, I saw people crawling in pains, trying to move away from where they were hit by the shrapnel of the blast. I thank God I left the mosque soon after the prayers because one of my customers was waiting at my shop which is not far from the emir's palace,"" Idi said.

Weekly Trust gathered that the incident happened at the mosque vicinity immediately after Juma'at prayers around 2:03pm when the Emir was heading to his palace after attending the congressional Friday prayer.

Another witness who does not want his name mentioned said the suicide bomber had strapped his body with many explosives and hid an AK47 riffle beneath his cloth.

""He (suicide bomber) tried to force his way and attack the monarch but was pushed back by the emir's orderly. He then brought out his gun when he saw he was going to be prevented from reaching his target. That was when the bomb exploded before he could make further progress.

""The strength of the explosive hurled the mutilated upper parts of the body of the attacker all over the place, including the roof of the mosque,"" he said.

A palace source said that an unknown person was earlier sighted in the emir's entourage inside the mosque but was asked to leave the place.

""Immediately after the prayer, the same person was sighted rushing towards the royal father,"" he said.

Shortly after the incident, sympathizers and worshippers at the scene were asked to leave the place to allow security operatives made up of police and army do their work after cordoning all routes leading the area but the move was resisted.

Mob refused to leave which led to a peaceful protest against a soldier who shot in the air to disperse the crowd. It took the intervention of some elders of the emirate council to calm frayed nerves.

A source at the Potiskum General Hospital, where the injured were taken to for treatment, said ""The emir's orderly is in the intensive care unit because of the gravity of the injuries he sustained.""

Meanwhile, there was tension in Potiskum as security intensified checks at military road blocks. The major road from Kano which passes by the Divisional Police Headquarters in Potiskum was blocked. ""The measure was taken to avoid further attack on the police,"" a Police source revealed.

In the last three years, over 1000 people, including soldiers, police, SSS, immigrations, customs, clerics and civilians have been killed, with most of the attacks being claimed by the Boko Haram.

Potiskum is the commercial nerve centre of Yobe State but wave of violence in the city has crippled socioeconomic life of the once famous city.

In May this year, over 150 people were killed at the Potiskum Cattle market, the largest in the northeast region."

A victim of the Kogi church attack on his hospital bed.

Lagos — TWENTY-FOUR hours after gunmen attacked worshippers at Deeper Life Church, Otite in Okehi Local Government of Kogi State, killing 16 persons, suspected terrorists yesterday attacked men of the Joint Task Force (JTF) guarding Okene Central Mosque and killed two soldiers attached to the team.

Sources said that the gunmen came to the premises of the mosque in a white Hilux Jeep trying to force their way into the mosque when Muslim faithful had gathered for their Tafsir prayer, opened fire and killed two soldiers.

The Military men, who were stationed at the Central Mosque returned fire and killed two of the gunmen before the rest escaped.

Kogi State Police Commissioner, Mr. Muhammed Katsina, who confirmed the incident, said that operatives of the command were on the trail of the gunmen.

Responding to the situation, the Kogi State Government declared a dusk-to-dawn curfew within Okene town and its environs.

Governor Idris Wada, who had earlier visited the church and General Hospital, decked in bullet proof vest, promised that the state government would pay the medical bills of victims, gave the directive during a statewide broadcast. He also restricted the movement of commercial motorcycle operators from 6am to 6pm in Lokoja, the state capital and Okene town and its environs.

Unexploded bomb discovered in another church in Kogi

To worsen increasing fear of insecurity in the state, a bomb was discovered at the Revival Church in Lokoja, the state capital. The Church which is located at Eika Adagu in Okehi Local Government Area is now surrounded by officers of the Nigeria Police Force and soldiers as family members of the deceased are coming around in tears, to identify their bodies.

IG orders 24-hour surveillance

Following intelligence reports that such attacks may be repeated in other parts of the state, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar has ordered a 24-hour surveillance of all places of worship and other vulnerable areas in Okene and other parts of the state.

According to a statement signed by Police Spokesman, CSP Frank Mba, the IG also ordered the immediate deployment of additional units of the Police Mobile Force from other Squadrons to beef up security arrangement in the state.

""The IG further appealed for calm among the people of Kogi State, promising that the perpetrators of 'this heinous crime will certainly not go unpunished"".

Gunmen planned to kill all worshippers -- Victims

Narrating how they survived the blood-chilling attack, some survivors said, yesterday, that if the gunmen, who attacked worshipers at the Deeper Life Church had their way, none of the about 80 worshippers would have survived.

Speaking on a day that the death toll of the attack rose to 20 following the death of four of the victims receiving treatment at one of the hospitals in Okene, the Zonal Coordinator of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Pastor Omotosho told Journalists that the plan of the gunmen was to kill everyone in the hall.

The presiding pastor of the church, Pastor Lambe Emmanuel was among those killed in the attack. The church Bible Study meeting usually attracts an estimated population of 80 per service.

He said that they received a distress call from one of the surviving pastors of the church that they were under attack, adding that when they rushed to the scene, it was a gory sight that greeted them as corpses of the worshipers littered everywhere in the church.

One of the victims who spoke from the hospital stated that when the gunmen came, they blocked the main entrance of the church and put off the generating set and instantly opened fire on the worshipers.

""We were in the Church for normal Bible studies on Monday evening when they besieged us. After shooting, they started spraying under benches in the church to ensure no one survived the onslaught.""

However, few members were lucky to have managed to find an escape route amidst bullets fired randomly while they were trying to run for cover.

Another survivor, Mr. Lawal Saliu, who sustained several gun shot wounds, told newsmen on his hospital bed at the Lokoja specialist hospital: ""I only saw two gunmen, who entered the church in a flowing gown during our usual bible study at around 11pm. Before we could say anything we started hearing gunshots I only woke up to find myself on this hospital bed, I don't even know how I got here.

Another victim, Mr Samuel Ayodele, said he lost his wife and a child. The Okene overseer of Deeper Life Church, Pastor Roland Egunjobi said the incident was the saddest moment of his life as most of the worshippers who were killed were children who came out for bible study with their parents.

This is coming as leading clerics, CAN, Senate President David Mark among others condemned the attacks and urged decisive action to stem the tide of insecurity.

Among clerics, who condemned the attack yesterday were CAN President, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor; the Primate of the Anglican Church, Reverend Nicholas Okoh; and Director of Social Communications at the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Rev. Monsignor Gabriel Osu.

Attack ungodly, wicked -Mark

Kicking against the mass killings of worshippers in Okene by gunmen, Senate President Mark, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Kola Ologbondiya, said, ""the attack on the Deeper Life Church, Okene, Kogi State as well as the places of worship in other states is ungodly and wicked."" He stressed that the wanton murder of people being carried out by gunmen must be combated through communal vigilance and enjoined Nigerians to take routine check of their environment very important to stop the abuse of communal living by gunmen.

Clerics condemn attack

Clerics expressed disgust over the continued attack on churches and innocent Christians across the country, without concerted efforts by the security outfits in the country to stop the perpetrators. They were unanimous in their belief that insecurity invariably breeds instability and therefore called on the Goodluck Jonathan administration to demonstrate the necessary political will to address the problem before it escalates to a full blown sectarian war.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, condemned the mindless attack on innocent worshippers. Speaking through the Special assistant to the National President of CAN, Mr. Kenny Ashaka, the CAN helmsman, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor said: ""We don't want a situation where many Christians are daily being slaughtered like animals. The latest attack on Christians is totally condemnable, intolerable because it is callous and inhuman.""

The CAN president therefore called on the Federal Government to take a decisive action on this nagging issue before it is too late, noting ""we have been at the forefront of this call"".

Speaking in an interview, National Secretary of the umbrella body of Pentecostalism in Nigeria, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, Pastor Wale Adefarasin condemned the attack on innocent Christians in Kogi State, saying it was extremely frustrating to continue to read of these mindless killing of innocent worshippers.

Reacting in a telephone interview, the Director of Social Communications at the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Rev. Monsignor Gabriel Osu also totally condemned the attack and the killing of 16 persons who were said to be attending a Bible study Monday evening.

""Anybody with his right senses and desires peace will condemn a barbaric act such as that,"" he said, noting that life is sacred and what has happened has again demonstrated that life no longer means nothing.

According to him, the latest killing in Kogi should be seen as a wake up call for the security personnel, political office holders and even the president of the Federal Republic, President Goodluck Jonathan and indeed everybody in the country.

Meanwhile the Deeper Life Christian Church has kept mum over the Okene Massacre. All efforts to get the leaders to comment on the issue had failed as they either refused to pick their calls or like in the case of the church secretary, Pastor Jerry Asemota simply told this reporter ""No comment"" and cut off the line. All other calls to his numbers were simply ignored.

Anglican Primate condemns attack

The Primate of the Anglican Church, Reverend Nicholas Okoh has condemned Monday's attack on a church in Okene, Kogi state which claimed the lives of 16 people.

Reverend Okoh who spoke with journalists in Abuja said that securing places of worship should not be left in the hands of the church alone.

He called on government to expedite action to secure the lives of its citizenry.

Responding to the call for the resignation of the president by members of the Boko Haram sect, the Anglican Primate said that the sect members are not responsible for Dr. Goodluck Jonathan's election and should therefore not call for his resignation."

Unknown gunmen

Gombe — Gunmen on Sunday morning attacked the All Saints Catholic Church, Kanoyel in Gombe State, killing a policeman who was on duty at the church.

A source said that the gunmen arrived at the church premises when the parishioners were coming out of the service and fired at the policemen.

The source said the gunmen also tried to gain entry into the church but that the parishioners shut the gate.

Rev. Fr. Williams Ochai, the Parish Priest of Church, said that the gunmen opened fire on the policemen deployed to guard the church during the mass.

According to him, as soon as the parishioners heard the gun shots, they immediately shut the gate to the church.

He, however, said one of the policemen died instantly while the other sustained serious injuries.

Reacting to the incidence, the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Gombe State, Rev. Abare Kalla, described it as unfortunate.

Kalla said CAN had an information that there would be an attack but did not know where it would occur, adding that security agents were informed.

The chairman said the aim of the attackers was to gain entry into the church but that they could not succeed because of the fence.

He confirmed that a policeman deployed to the area was killed in the incident while another sustained injuries.

Kalla commiserated with the family of the policeman and prayed for the recovery of the injured.

When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Ibrahim Abdullahi, told NAN on phone that he was in Abuja.

He directed reporters to the Command's Public Relations Officer, Mr Fwaje Atajiri, a Deputy Superintendent of Police.

""I have been promoted to the position of an Assistant Inspector-General of Police and I am now in Abuja for that purpose. So, get in touch with my PPRO,"" he said.

Fwaje, however, on phone said that it was only the Commissioner that would comment on the issue. NAN"

Twenty members of the terrorist group were killed in Maiduguri, in what was regarded as a major offensive against the Boko Haram sect after the 2009 siege where scores of its members were killed.

The Joint Task Force (JTF) in Borno State said in a statement that the 20 were killed during a shootout late Saturday night in Maiduguri.

In Damaturu, however, two of the insurgents were killed when a group of the sect engaged the JTF in a shootout.

A source said the JTF had launched an offensive against the sect after receiving an intelligence report that Boko Haram members were meeting at one of their hideouts in Maiduguri to finalise plans to attack the town.

The source said the pre-emptive strike by the JTF had saved the town from violence as the meeting was targeted at attacking Maiduguri and its environs.

Confirming the strike on the phone to journalists, the Field Operations Officer of JTF in Borno State, Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, said during the attack where 20 sect members were killed, one soldier was killed and two others sustained gunshot injuries.

He said: ""We got intelligence reports that some suspected Boko Haram terrorists were having a meeting at a particular location in the metropolis. When we approached the venue of their meeting, the terrorists opened fire on the JTF which led to the killing of 20 of the terrorists, while we lost one soldier and two others sustained injuries.""

Ebhaleme attributed the latest success against the sect to the new tactic, ""Humanitarian Line of Operation"", which has seen the JTF embracing members of the civil society.

In Damaturu, police sources said that the siege on some of Boko Haram's hideouts lasted between 6 am and 11 am in Bagandari, Powari and Pompomari areas of Damaturu.

Confirming the incident, Yobe State Police Commissioner, Mr. Patrick Egbuniwe, said two suspected terrorists were shot dead yesterday during the exchange of gunfire with security forces in Damaturu.

According to him, ""Two insurgents were killed during the exchange of gun shots between the Joint Task Force operatives and suspected Boko Haram members.""

Egbuniwe, however, added that calm had returned to Damaturu and its environs. ""People are going about their normal activities,"" he said."

... as Suswam reads riot act to warring communities

BY Peter Duru

Governor Gabriel Suswam of Benue State has threatened to arrest and prosecute any paramount ruler in the state, who through commission or omission, encourages or fuels communal conflicts in any part of the state.

The governor handed down the warning in Otukpo, where he held a reconciliatory meeting with stakeholders and paramount rulers of the warring Ojantele and Ijekwu communities in Otukpo and Obi local government areas.

He said: ""What has happened in your communities that led to deaths and destruction of lives and property is, to say the least, unacceptable and condemnable.

""It is more painful because we hardly hear of such sad developments in this part of the state; and that is the more reason why you must all talk to your people to desist from further escalating the crisis.

""I must also caution that if the fighting continues, we will not hesitate to apprehend the paramount rulers of the affected communities and if necessary, we will also not hesitate to depose them."""

By Michael Olugbode and Mohammed Aminu

The Joint Task Force (JTF) in Borno State, Operation Restore Order, Monday claimed that the success of its operations in recent time was as a result of planting its moles among the ranks of the Boko Haram sect.

The declaration came on the heels of the killing of a cleric, alongside his son and one of his siblings in Maiduguri.

However, some suspected gunmen on Sunday, killed an Islamic scholar, Malam Liman Danda Birkitawa, at Dabagi village in Dange Shuni local government area of Sokoto State.

But eyewitnesses in Maiduguri said the cleric, before he was shot dead, was trailed by members of the sect to Bulabin area, behind the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) staff quarters at about 9pm on Sunday.

Similarly, another witness said the cleric was shot dead immediately he was sighted, before his two relatives were hacked down by the sect members.

On the planting of moles within the ranks of the group, the spokesman of the JTF, Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, said the success of the task force was largely responsible for this as well as the cooperation of the public.

He said the task force conducted a follow up operation at the residence of a wanted key commander of Boko Haram in Bulumkutu-Lawanti area of Maiduguri metropolis.

He said the operation was carried out at about 5:30am Monday, where three AK 47 rifles, a 306x 7.62 mm special ammunition, a Primed Improvised Explosive Device (IED) cans, six empty magazine cans, one HP Laptop computer containing précis on preparation of IED and chemical weapons were recovered.

Musa also said a notebook register containing names of Boko Haram members, indicating those already dead, 54 different kinds of SIM cards, 40 IED remote control, 20 different kinds of electrical switches, 50 Qlink motorcycle battery chargers, 20 torchlight batteries and a RPG Bomb Fuse.

Meanwhile, THISDAY checks revealed that the incident occurred at the weekend, when the assailants numbering about four stormed the victim’s village in Sokoto with two motorcycles and shot him.

It was gathered that the cleric died on the spot, while two members of his family were shot during the attack.

THISDAY learnt that the two victims were later rushed to the Usmanu Danfodio University Teaching Hospital (UDUTH) Sokoto by the villagers where they are now receiving treatment.

The son of the deceased, Muhammed Bello, told journalists that the gunmen arrived the village and shot sporadically before gaining access to the private room of the deceased.

According to him, when the gunmen discovered that there was pandemonium in the village, they swiftly entered his father’s room and shot him dead.

“Some youths arrived and asked for my father and before we could realize what their mission was, they have already gunned him down and also shot two of my siblings, who are now in the hospital,” he said.

The Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), Sani Salisu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), who confirmed the incident, told THISDAY that the command had commenced investigation with a view to unmask those who killed the cleric.

Salisu, who disclosed that the two victims that were injured in the attack, have been discharged from the hospital, assured that the police was determined to apprehend the perpetrators of the act."

Seven persons, including three policemen, were shot dead in the raids on targets in Ojodu, Ikeja, Surulere and Agege, among others. Those who were lucky among the victims, including a year-old baby, Taiye, were left with varying degrees of injuries.

The robbers had first struck at a bureau de change in Gbagada area before moving on to Ojodu and Ikeja. Another gang was believed to have launched attacks on targets around Anthony, Oshodi, Itire, Agege, Bariga, Ilasamanja and Adelabu Street in Surulere.

In what looked like well-coordinated attacks, the robbers held the citizenry of the state in different areas to ransom while the operations lasted. It could, however, not be confirmed if the robbers were of the same or different gangs.

THISDAY gathered that the armed gang had successfully looted the bureau-de-change after shooting some people. The volley of bullets from the robbers scared residents away from the streets while the operation lasted. The terror-struck residents resorted to using the social media network, especially twitter, Facebook and blackberry messages to announce the attacks and to warn others against coming into the neighbourhood.

It was also gathered that in their attempt to make a successful get-away with their loot, the robbers had engaged a patrol team of the RRS with registration number 5251 which they met at Guinness Bus Stop, Oba Akran Road, Ikeja, in a gun duel which resulted in the death of two police officers.

Eyewitness accounts said the robbers outgunned the police officers because they took them unawares. According to an eyewitness simply identified as Akin, the RRS patrol vehicle was not aware that the SUV that was driving by had armed robbers in it and so were not prepared for the onslaught of gunfire that greeted their approach.

However, another report said the robbers opened fire on the RRS team when the policemen were pursuing them. According to eyewitnesses, the police team were pursuing the robbers when both sides engaged in a gun duel at Guinness Bus Stop.

Another gang, which operated on a motorcycle at Anthony Bus Stop on the Ikorodu Expressway, was said to have shot a Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) official identified as Sosan on both legs.

Confirming the shooting of the official, the Public Relations Officer, LASTMA, Bola Ajao, said the official was responding to treatment at an undisclosed hospital where he was rushed to for treatment.

She said: ""The robbers at Anthony were said to have operated on a commercial motorcycle and shot some of the LASTMA officials on duty even though they were not armed.

""The bullets pierced through Sosan's right leg and entered into the left. He lost a lot of blood but he was rushed to the hospital on time and he's responding to treatment.""

At Gbagada, besides robbing another bureau de change, the robbers also raided traders such as restaurant owners, recharge card sellers, pedestrians and motorists. Eyewitness account disclosed that the robbers who came in two vehicles, an SUV and a Toyota Camry salon car, shot sporadically into the air to scare away the residents.

It was also gathered that some policemen, numbering about three, who had attempted to confront the armed robbers were forced to beat a hasty retreat when one of them was shot.

It was gathered that one of the stray bullets from the robbers hit Taiye who was playing outside. Taiye is currently receiving treatment at the Gbagada General Hospital.

Also affected was another resident of the area, one Abiodun Sikiru, who had hidden inside his car.

Confirming the attack, the Chairman of one of the bureaux de change, Alhaji Jubril Mukaila, lamented the manner of the robbery, saying that one of his workers was shot.

According to him, he and several others had geared up for the business of the day when the robbers stormed the area and attacked them. He said the robbers had accosted him for money and when he hesitated, one of them shot one of his assistants identified as Asumo.

He said: ""They riddled my entire shop with bullets and took away all the money in my drawer and then pushed Asumo and I on the floor and carried chairs and placed them on top of us before fleeing. They then robbed my colleagues as well.""

While the robbers were escaping, they also shot a policeman who was stationed at PWD, around the Ikeja railway.

At Agege, stray bullets were said to have hit a young girl in the eye as well as an elderly woman who was resting in her home. Also affected was a vehicle belonging to the Motolani Medical Centre whose windscreen was shattered by bullets from the robbers.

At the Ikeja area of the state, a three-man armed gang also gunned down a policeman and a commercial bus driver on the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.

Eyewitness account said the gunmen who had trailed the commercial bus conveying the policeman and other passengers from Oshodi, blocked the bus at Ikeja-Along Bus Stop before opening fire on the policeman and the driver who died instantly. The driver's death caused the LT commercial bus marked XQ 336 EKY to skid off the road onto the railway track.

However, the gang that operated in Surulere area met its match in the policemen in the area who were able to dislodge them from the neighbourhood.

Attempts to confirm the incidents from the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, were unsuccessful as several calls put across to her lines were unanswered.

But the state Commissioner of Police, Umar Manko, confirmed the attacks and the death of the three police officers, adding that the situation was under control.

He, however, urged Lagosians to go about their activities without fear as the police would ensure their safety.

Human rights lawyer, Mr. Bamidele Aturu

Prominent lawyers, Prof. Itse Sagay, Mr. Bamidele Aturu, and the Legal Defence and Assistance Project have called for the prosecution of security personnel involved in recent extrajudicial killings in Lagos State.

While reacting to the increasing reports of extra-judicial killings in the state, Sagay, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, decried the manner in which security operatives, who should protect lives, have been involved in illegal killings.

He said, “Extrajudicial killing is always a major offence. I rank it as a crime against humanity. It is an illegal execution. Policemen are becoming unreliable and untrustworthy by taking lives instead of protecting them. We no longer trust the police.

“The Inspector-General and the commissioners have to clamp down on their officials so as to have a police force that will protect and not kill us.”

Similarly, Aturu, a human rights lawyer, berated security agencies for the killings, adding that the trend would continue if left unchecked.

He said, “The extrajudicial killings are unlawful, unconstitutional, wicked, indefensible and an act of lawlessness. The people who should protect lives are now taking lives and that is immoral.”

The National Coordinator, LEDAP, Mr. Chino Obiagwu, also told our correspondent that the enforcement of the new Lagos Road Traffic Law had led to an abuse of power by the security agents and manhandling of traffic offenders.

He said, “Unfortunately, nobody monitors the implementation of the law. some people have either been shot or killed in the last few months and nobody is being prosecuted for these extrajudicial killings. “In advanced countries, motorcycles have their lanes but Lagos has none.”

On November 10, an employee of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Femi Badejo, and his security guard, Joshua Moses, were shot by policemen in Lagos, who were responding to a distress call.

Badejo, who later had four out of five bullets in his body removed at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos Island, said he and his neighbours were in the compound discussing how the armed robbers attacked their home in Ikota, when the policemen stormed the building and started shooting sporadically.

On November 7, a policeman, Oluwatiyesi Gboyega, attached to the Alapere Police Division, Ketu, Lagos, allegedly shot and killed a bus conductor at Tipper Bus Stop during an argument over N50.

Also on November 6, a policeman identified as Yemi allegedly shot an Okada rider, Adigun Atilola, in Ilupeju area of Lagos State, while trying to enforce the new state traffic law.

It was gathered that Yemi, who was in company with five other officers, allegedly shot Atilola when he attempted to evade arrest at Teju Junction, Ilupeju.

Earlier on October 17, a policeman attached to Ago Police Division, Okota, Lagos, allegedly shot two men, Adebisi Adewole and Gbenga Abiodun, at GKS Bus Stop, Ago Palace Road, for attempting to intervene in the arrest of commercial motorcycle riders plying restricted routes by some policemen.

Similarly, on October 23, an unidentified policeman from Pen Cinema Police Division, Agege, Lagos State, allegedly killed an Okada rider identified simply as Omo Saki, after hitting him with a baton on the head on Oba Ogunnusi Road, Ogba.

It would be recalled that five days after his wedding to Joan, 36-year-old Ugochukwu Ozuah, was on September 20, 2012, allegedly killed by policemen attached to the Anthony Division.

It was learnt that five policemen were arrested and under interrogation by the Federal Criminal Investigation Department constituted by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar.

When contacted, Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, told SUNDAY PUNCH that the agency was investigating all the cases, adding that it would handle them with fairness.

He said, “All the cases are under investigation. If at the end of the investigation anyone is found culpable, the force will ensure proper prosecution. Such cases have been reported and we have always been fair in handling them.”"

Bauchi Church Bomb Blast

Bauchi — A suicide bomber, yesterday, attacked the Saint John's Catholic Church in Bauchi, opposite Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium, killing four people and injuring 46 others.

Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, Hassan Mohammed Auyo, who confirmed the incident to Vanguard, said: ""When a suicide bomber attempted to gain entrance into the premises of the church, he could not because of the barricade of the church.

The suicide bomber then decided to detonate the bomb in the parking lot, killing himself and three others, while several others sustained injuries. The injured victims were taken to the hospital for treatment. A boy between the ages of six and eight died while receiving treatment"" ASP Hassan added that two other policemen deployed to protect the church sustained injuries.

The Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Bauchi State chapter, Rev. Lawi Pokti, who narrated how the incident occurred said, ""the incident occurred around 8.55a.m. when the first set of worshipers were coming out of the church and the second session was about to start.

The suicide bomber came in an Opel saloon car but could not get through to the church premises; so he hit the barricade at the gate and detonated his explosive device.

""He and three worshipers died while over 40 others were injured. Some of those injured are battling between life and death,"" he said.

A worshipper, Mr Osondu Chukwu, told the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, that but for the barricade, the casualties would have been more. The sound was massive and you can imagine if he had succeeded in getting to the hall where service was taking place,"" he said.

Mr Adamu Abubakar, the Secretary of the Nigeria Red Cross in Bauchi State, also confirmed to NAN on telephone that three persons died with the bomber.

""Three persons died and 48 others were injured. Those injured are now being treated at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Teaching Hospital, Bauchi,"" he said.

Tambuwal condemns bomb attack

Reacting to the bomb attack, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, condemned the suicide attack, describing it as ignoble, wicked and horrendous.

In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Malam Imam Imam, the Speaker urged security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of the violent act were brought to justice.

He said the gains recorded by the security agencies in their battle against terror in the country in recent weeks should be built upon in order to protect the citizens at all times.

While condoling with the victims of the blast, Tambuwal urged Nigerians to be more prayerful and to provide useful information that would lead to the arrest of the perpetrators and their sponsors, if any.

1,000 troops deployed to Damaturu

Meanwhile, following confirmation that scores of Boko Haram adherents relocated to Damaturu to continue their bombing activities and use the anti-Islamic protests as pretext for violence, military authorities have deployed about 1, 000 soldiers and other security agents in Yobe State.

The deployment of the soldiers, according to JTF sources, came just as over 1, 000 persons were arrested by JTF along Maiduguri Road following intelligence reports of plans to unleash gun and bomb attacks on prominent citizens, communication facilities and churches in the state.

Vanguard was, however, told by some indigenes of Damaturu that 45 civil servants were among the over 1, 000 persons arrested by the troops alleging that efforts to identify themselves were brushed aside by the troops.

The action of the soldiers to go all out for suspects over the alert was said to have caused pandemonium along Maiduguri Road, which is the only area where commercial activities are said to be picking up following the onslaught of the insurgents in the state.

Speaking on the arrests, spokesman for JTF in Damaturu, Lieutenant Eli Lazarus, noted that the deployment of the troops comprising soldiers, anti-terrorist squad and regular policemen, as well as others being expected, was to enable them subdue the insecurity and other challenges in the state. Vanguard learnt that the 1, 000 troops deployed to Damaturu were camped in Kukareti."

Bombs, weapons and ammunition were discovered during a Joint Task Force raid on the home of Boko Haram spokesperson Abu Qaqa in Kano.

Security agents made another major breakthrough yesterday with the killing of a top suspected member of the insurgent group Boko Haram and the arrest of 156 others in Mubi, Adamawa State.

Mubi, which is about an hour's drive from Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, and one-and-a-half hour's drive from Damaturu in Yobe State, both focal points of Boko Haram activities, is a major base of the Boko Haram in Adamawa State.

Operatives of the special security squad, ""Operation Restore Sanity"", made the arrest during a raid on the insurgents' hideout in Mubi which led to a gun battle with the terrorists in which one of the Boko Haram key commanders, believed to be Abubakar Yola, alias Abu Jihad, was killed.

Four of the 156 persons arrested are also believed to be top unit commanders of the sect involved in the recent bombings of telecommunications facilities in the North-east about three weeks ago.

The security operatives also rescued five women and six children from a house suspected to have been used by Boko Haram as its main ammunition dump.

Conducting reporters round the enclave, the Brigade Commander, 23rd Armoured Brigade, Brig.-Gen. John Nwoaga, accompanied by the state Police Commissioner, Mr. P. C. Okeke, and the Director of the State Security Services (SSS), Mr. Olugbenga Jayeoba, said the kingpin was shot by soldiers, while resisting arrest.

He said that over 300 improvised explosive devices already primed for detonation, 25 assorted brands of rifles, mostly brand new AK 47, submachine guns and over 2,000 daggers, swords, bows and poisoned arrows, were recovered from the hideout.

Also recovered was a huge quantity of bomb making devices, which was stored in a large compound situated at Shagari Low Cost Housing, Mubi.

Nwoaga said security agents were compelled to impose a 24-hour security cordon on Mubi for the last two days before they could track down the sect members.

He appealed to traditional rulers and community leaders to advise their people to keep the peace and report suspicious persons to the security agencies, stressing that bomb explosions do not discriminate along tribal or religious line.

Monday's killing of Abu Jihad is coming one week after the Joint Military Task Force (JTF) claimed to have killed a key member of the sect and arrested two others in Kano.

JTF spokesman, Lieutenant Ikedichi Iweha, said the operation was carried out by the security personnel in Hotoro in the Kano metropolis.

Iweha, who did not confirm the identity of those killed or arrested, said the military task force had carried out an operation in the early hours of Monday, last week, during which it killed one terrorist and arrested two others.

However, it was gathered that the sect member who was killed and the two others arrested were among the most wanted members of Boko Haram by the security agencies.

There were speculations that the sect's spokesman, Abu Qaqa, a nom de guerre used by the spokesmen of the sect, was alleged to have been killed, while other sources revealed that among those arrested included a woman, who was alleged to have been close to members of the sect.

Since it intensified its attacks on security agents, particularly in Borno, Bauchi and Yobe States following the killing of its leader, Mohammed Yusuf in 2009, Boko Haram has killed more than 1,400 people since 2010 just as the attacks have spread to Kano, Kaduna, Niger, Plateau States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)."

By Harris-Okon Emmanuel, Correspondent, Warri

Kwale, headquarters of Ndokwa West council of Delta State, has been thrown into mourning following the alleged killing of the Head of Personnel Management (HPM) of Isoko North council of the state, Bernard Chigwe, by armed Fulani herdsmen.

Sources in Kwale said Chigwe, who hailed from the area had gone to his farm on Sunday and found cattle grazing on his farm, and reportedly went to the Police station to lay a complaint. A source said that was the second time such incident was happening on his farm.

It was gathered that the deceased later went back to the farm accompanied by some policemen from the Kwale station and on arrival, the herdsmen on sighting the police were said to have taken to their heels.

Daily Independent gathered that as the drama was playing out, an unknown armed person suspected to be one of the herdsmen allegedly fired a shot at the HPM from behind, which felled him, and was immediately rushed to the hospital , but he gave up the ghost before he could get medical attention

Chigwe’s corpse has been deposited at one of the hospital mortuaries at Kwale, it was further gathered.

When ontacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chrales Muka, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, who confirmed the incident, said investigation was on, adding, “For now, we cannot confidently say whether the HPM was killed by the Fulani cattle rearers because investigations are still on and we wouldn’t pre-empt our investigations.”

It would be recalled that before his death, the deceased was reported to have had disagreement with his staff few weeks ago following his inability to pay their August salaries.

FOLLOWING a tip off that members of the Boko Haram were planning a major suicide mission in Zaria, Kaduna and Suleja, Niger State, to coincide with the Independence anniversary celebration, the military and the State Security Service (SSS) on Sunday launched a joint operation on a residential building in Gaskiya Layout, Zaria, Kaduna State, to flush out the terrorists.

During the operation some of the Boko Haram members were killed and others, including a woman, were arrested.

It was also discovered that the building was heavily loaded with explosives and being used as warehouse for storage of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).

The army shot at the suspected mini bomb factory which exploded and destroyed about seven houses in the area. Calm has returned in Zaria and environs but there was intensive stop and search by the military at check points along major roads across the state.

During the operation, the military shot and killed two suspected Boko Haram members while 10 others sustained varying degrees of injury and were rushed to an undisclosed location.

An eyewitness said during the military operation on Sunday morning, the military stormed a hideout where the suspected Boko Haram members were hiding in Zaria and disorganised them. As some were making attempts to escape, the military shot, killing two, injuring ten others.

According to a source,""the operation followed a tip-off by patriotic citizens.""

""The Army Public Relations Officer at the Depot Army, Captain Ibrahim Abdullahi, confirmed the incident. He said in a release that in the early hours of Sunday, suspected members of Boko Haram engaged their troops and the SSS in a fierce gun battle in Gaskiya Layout, Tukur-Tukur, Zaria.""

Investigations had since commenced to unravel the activities of terrorists in the area and determine the extent of involvement of those apprehended.

Meanwhile, tragedy struck at the weekend in Minna, Niger State, as three policemen were attacked by some unidentified gunmen, leaving two of the policemen dead while the third escaped death by a whisker.

The incident occurred at about 8.25 p.m. on Saturday when the policemen were on a stop and search duty around Kpakungu roundabout in Chanchaga Local Government Area of the state and some 50 metres away from the community’s Divisional Police Headquarters under the state Police Command.

Nigerian Tribune further gathered that no sooner had the hoodlums carried out the attack on the policemen than they quickly boarded their operational vehicle and sped off from the scene and disappeared into the night before the surviving policeman could call for re-nforcement from the nearby police station.

It was further learnt that as soon as the news of the attack on the policemen spread among the community, residents and neighbouring communities like Gbagannu and Gidan Mangoro were gripped with fear that the unidentified hoodlums might strike before daybreak on Sunday.

Some insider police sources informed Nigerian Tribune that the policemen were allegedly caught unawares by the suspected armed robbers at their duty post while sitting down and were engrossed in a discussion when they were supposed to be conducting a stop and search duty at the spot.

The source who craved for anonymity stated that one of the fallen policemen was a constable while the other one was a sergeant who was recently transferred from the Police Secondary School, Minna, adding that their corpses had been deposited at the mortuary of the General Hospital, Minna.

It was further learnt that the hoodlums carted away one AK 47 rifle allegedly belonging to one of the deceased Policemen who were killed in Minna on Saturday.

Also reacting to the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer, Niger State Command, Mr Pius Edobor, confirmed the incident in an interview with Nigerian Tribune in Minna on Sunday."

It was a black Independence Day celebration for the inhabitants of Mubi town, Adamawa State, as unknown gunmen, suspected to be members of Boko Haram, massacred at least 46 persons, mostly students of three tertiary institutions in the town

It was a black Independence Day celebration for the inhabitants of Mubi town, Adamawa State, as unknown gunmen, suspected to be members of Boko Haram, massacred at least 46 persons, mostly students of three tertiary institutions in the town, on Monday night.

At least three others were confirmed killed over the weekend in Bauchi State in the ongoing reprisals in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area.

Although the official casualty figure in the Mubi killing was put at 25, sources said the figure could be higher as no fewer than 26 students of the Federal Polytechnic alone were shot dead.

Students of other schools attacked were from the School of Health Technology and the Adamawa State University, all in Mubi.

The victims, a source said, were shot dead in what he described as a ""commando style attack"".

An official of the Federal Polytechnic, who craved anonymity for security reasons, told THISDAY in a phone interview that the shooting took place at about 10pm, when the gunmen opened fire on some students at Wuro-Fatuje. Wuro-Fatuje, a suburb of Mubi, is heavily populated by off-campus students of the three institutions.

""There was heavy gunfire from around 10pm until 11pm, when it subsided,"" he said.

He confirmed that 26 students of the polytechnic were among the casualties, while the others were students of the two other institutions.

According to him, the bodies of the victims have been deposited at the General Hospital, Mubi.

By Tuesday, operatives of the internal joint security task force, headed by Brig-Gen. John Nwoaga, along with the state Police Commissioner, Geofrey Okeke, had beefed up security in the town with the deployment of more soldiers and policemen in the town that was locked down last week by security agents in search of Boko Haram insurgents.

Adamawa State Police Command spokesman, Ibrahim Mohammed, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed that 25 bodies had so far been deposited at the General Hospital, Mubi.

He, however, said the figure might rise as security agents were still in the area combing for more victims.

Also, the spokesman of National Emergency Agency (NEMA), Alhaji Yushua Shuaib, confirmed over the phone that 25 people were killed in the attack on the students.

According to him, the number of the injured could not yet be determined as security agents were still combing the area for bodies and injured victims.

He, however, said calm had been restored following the beefing up of security in the town by a combined team of soldiers and policemen.

Last week, agents of the special squad in the state, ""Operation Restore Sanity"", had recorded a major breakthrough when they killed one of the key commanders of the Boko Haram believed to be Abubakar Yola, alias Abu Jihad, during a gun duel with the insurgents in Mubi.

Also arrested were 156 persons, four of whom are believed to be top unit commanders of the sect involved in the recent bombings of telecommunications facilities about a month ago.

Also discovered and destroyed were two bomb factories of the sect, including over 300 improvised explosive devices already primed for attacks."

It was learnt that the policemen were arresting commercial motorcycle riders plying restricted routes when the two men attempted to intervene.

Our correspondent learnt that the victims, Adebisi Adewole and Gbenga Abiodun, are employees of Ekayus Limited, dealers in iron rod and building materials.

According to eyewitness accounts, the victims were shot at GKS Bus Stop, Ago Palace Road, Okota.

The victims were said to have been shot for persuading the policemen at a checkpoint in front of their shop, not to arrest a commercial motorcyclist.

An eyewitness, who craved anonymity, said, “The policemen were chasing a motorcycle operator in a bid to arrest him but while attempting to escape, he (okada rider) rode into a ditch.

“Upon noticing that the policemen were bent on arresting him, the victims who had closed for the day appealed to the policemen to let him go since he (the motorcyclist) had already sustained injuries from his fall.

“The appeal infuriated one of the policemen who immediately opened fire and the bullets hit the victims.”

The manager of the company, who was identified simply as Gbenga, confirmed the incident. He said they had made peace with the police over the matter.

He said, “The police have apologised to us. They said the shooting was an error as they did not intend to shoot my colleagues. They said it was an accidental discharge that wasn’t directly aimed at the victims.

“ So, we have listened to their plea and opted to forgive them. We have let go of the issue.”

Efforts to confirm the incident from the state Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, proved abortive, as she neither picked phone calls nor replied a text message sent to her phone."

Some other policemen on patrol with the cops were also injured in the incident.

The policemen were said to be attached to the Ogidi Police Station, Idemili North Local Government Area.

The gunmen were also said to have led some people to destroy part of a hotel building under construction in the area.

The building allegedly belongs to the Chairman of Abor Akuzor kindred, Chief Okechukwu Nwafoagu.

The killing of the two policemen came on the heels of a similar killing of a woman, Ogechi Okechukwu, on Sunday by gunmen, who attacked the village.

The hoodlums were alleged have used explosives suspected to be dynamite to destroy the mega hotel.

The Abor Akuzor people have been embroiled in a land dispute with their neighbouring Oramadike people in Ogidi.

The dispute, which sometimes turned violent, has led to loss of lives and destruction of property.

The Monday attack on Abor Akuzor was the third since May this year. The hotel, which is at the roofing stage, was attacked and property including generators, were set ablaze.

The Police Monitoring Unit, Force Headquarters, had, because of the killings and destruction, summoned the Chairman of Abor Akuzor and his Oramadike counterpart to Abuja, where they were made to sign an undertaking to maintain the peace and order.

Nwafoagu, whose hotel and property were destroyed, blamed the police for not acting early on the information his people had given them.

He said, “In all the attacks, I have always called the security agencies in and outside the state and sent text messages to all their heads. I have been saying it that the activities of these hoodlums should be checked to avoid loss of lives.

“My people have provided necessary information on where to arrest them, their source of arms, yet these information have not been acted upon.”"

Police patrol teams were immediately withdrawn from the metropolis on Tuesday shortly after the killing.

Our correspondent found that the incident which occurred at about 5pm on Monday threw the popular road which has many bars and brothels into panic.

Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that after shooting the boy, the policemen immediately fled the area.

One of the eyewitnesses who identified herself simply as Charity said the killer policeman was seen running after the boy.

She said the policeman who was some miles away from the teenager opened fire on him but made a U-turn after discovering that he had died.

She said sympathisers who later approached the body discovered that the boy was shot in the head.

She also claimed that the victim’s girl friend was arrested by the police.

“Many of us witnessed it. We saw the boy running and we also saw a policeman chasing him with a gun. Suddenly we heard gunshots, and saw the boy fell to the ground with blood gushing out of his head,” Edna claimed.

She said the body of the victim was on the road for over an hour before a police patrol van from the “A” Division came and took it away.

The Police Command Public Relations Officer, Mr. Fidelis Odunna, confirmed that the police took away the body of the victim but said he had yet to know the circumstances that led to his death.

“I can confirm the death of a youth because I was driving along the road when I saw the corpse of the boy lying on the road. I then called the Police Division in charge of the area to come and remove it,” he said.

He said the remains were taken to the mortuary for autopsy, adding that investigation had commenced on the matter.

The Islamists Boko Haram based in northern Nigeria have killed a Cameroonian mayor, raising fears about how far the sect members could stretch their wrath.

Mr Abba Djidda Alahdji, third deputy mayor of Makary in Cameroon’s Far North Region, was killed because of his suspected ties with a Nigerian police commissioner, local tabloid La Nouvelle Expression reported.

The mayor’s slaying on Nigerian soil followed a string of warnings from the sect, according to reports.

The sect, which wants to radically alter the current education system and impose Sharia law across Nigeria, had been keeping an eye on his friendship and constant visits to the police commissioner of a town in northern Nigeria.

An ongoing crackdown by Nigerian security forces on the group poses a major hindrance to its activities.

Boko Haram related violence has claimed over 2,800 lives in Nigeria since 2009, according to a recent Human Rights Watch report.

Across the border, Cameroon political and religious authorities have also been taking steps to guard against letting the country slip into chaos akin to Nigeria’s due to the sect’s activities.

The mayor, according to La Nouvelle Expression, was gunned down after prayers on October 5 by two men who trailed him to where he lived with one of his wives.

Nigerian intelligence officials believe Boko Haram planned some of its attacks from northern Cameroon, which it uses as a safe haven and a source of arms.

In February 2011, security forces in Nigeria’s Borno State uncovered a cache of weapons they said was smuggled into the territory from Cameroon.

Nigeria also shut its porous border with Cameroon after last year’s Christmas Day Bombings which killed over 35 people.

Muslim cleric and head of the Union of Cameroonian Imams, Sheik Ibrahim Mbombo Mubarak, said in August 2011 that Boko Haram had a growing Cameroonian following.

Many feared dead as gunmen attack Yobe village

Unknown gunmen have attacked Dogon Kuka village in Yobe State, killing and injuring an unspecified number of people.

The gunmen invaded the village on Saturday, and started firing indiscriminately.

Two people died immediately, the Commissioner of Police, Yobe State Command, Patrick Egbuniwe, confirmed to Agence France Presse.

“A group of unknown gunmen stormed Dogon Kuka village and opened fire on residents. From all indications, they were on a shooting spree. From reports reaching us, some people might have been killed,” Egbuniwe told AFP.

The state police commissioner said he could not put a figure on the number of deaths.

“I don’t have details yet but we have deployed security personnel to the village to ascertain the nature and extent of the attack,” he said.

He declined to say if the attackers were members of the extremist Boko Haram, which has been blamed for a string of deadly attacks in several parts of Yobe State and neighbouring Borno State.

The village is about 70 kilometres (45 miles) from Damaturu, the state capital.

BARELY six days after the Independence’s day tragedy in Mubi, Adamawa State, where over 40 students were murdered by yet-to-be identified gunmen, suspected Boko Haram militants, on Saturday evening in Yobe State, went on the rampage, killing about 17 persons, in Doko Kuka village.





The latest orgy of violence, Nigerian Tribune authoritatively learnt, had a semblance with the Mubi killing as the gunmen invaded the village in the dead of the night, shooting their victims, a development which forced some of the inhabitants of Dogon Kuka, who managed to escape the attack, to flee into the thick forest.

Investigation revealed that operatives of the Joint Task Force (JTF) were said to have engaged the terrorists in a gun duel that lasted for more than 45 minutes before they retreated from the village.

A resident, identified as Suleiman Sanni told Nigerian Tribune that “It was a terrible experience as many bullets were flying around when the JTF was battling to dislodge the Boko Haram sect members. The sound of the gunshots was deafening and everybody had to run for his or her life. Even, the fear has spread to the state capital, Damaturu. People are leaving in large number and I heard some of the terrorists have been apprehended by the JTF soldiers.”

At the time of filing this report, Boko Haram had not claimed responsibility for the attack in Dogon Kuka, inhabited by Muslims, which is about 70 kilometres from Damaturu, but the authorities of the JTF cautioned that anybody or community that harbours terrorists, criminals and other categories of hoodlums would be dealt with according to the dictates of law.

Sources informed the Nigerian Tribune that with the growing insecurity in the state, which had paralysed socio-economic activities, culminating in the closure of some financial institutions, including banks, terrified residents left in droves. Some political functionaries have also temporarily moved their families to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, for fear of being attacked by gunmen.

Confirming the killing to newsmen on Sunday, the Yobe State Commissioner of Police, Mr Patrick Egbuniwe, stated that “a group of unknown gunmen stormed Dogon Kuka village and opened fire on residents. From all indications, they were on a shooting spree. Some people might have been killed.”

On the number of casualties, the police boss said, “I don’t have details yet, but we have deployed security personnel to the village to ascertain the nature and extent of the attack.”

While declining to confirm if the gunmen were members of the Boko Haram sect, which has been blamed for a string of deadly attacks in several parts of Yobe and neighbouring Borno states, Egbuniwe said security agencies were on top of the situation, assuring that the police would not relent in their efforts to ensure security of lives and properties.

Reacting to the incident, the JTF spokesman in Yobe, Lieutenant Eli Lazarus, said operatives of the special security force had restored normalcy to the troubled village, warning that anybody or individuals with useful information over threat to security should not hesitate to report to the JTF.

Similarly, the JTF spokesman in Borno State, Lieutenant-Colonel Sagir Musa, on Sunday, advised residents of the state to remain calm and be security conscious by giving timely information on any suspicious movements, persons or groups, pointing out that no effort would be spared to protect the people.

In another development, gunmen in Zaria, Kaduna State, at the weekend hit a tarverna, killing a medical doctor and one other person

The police have since begun investigation into the killing which an eyewitness described as gruesome.

An eyewitness said the gunmen entered the relaxation spot at about 8.00 p.m. on the Enugu/Kings road, Sabo Garin, Zaria and shot at the medical doctor whose name was given as Dr Martins Agu, of Railway Staff Hospital, Zaria.

“Also shot dead was a man believed to be Dr Agu’s friend and a lady companion whose leg was said to have been shattered by bullets,” the eyewitness said.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Kaduna State, DSP Aminu Lawan, said two men on a motorcycle opened fire on people relaxing at a beer parlour.





“Three persons were affected, but it was two of them that were killed; the third person was injured. Our men were able to get to the scene of the incident when they heard the gunshot, and they picked up some exhibits which will help us in trailing the culprits. What I cannot confirm to you is whether one of the victims is a medical doctor or not.

“The sound of the gunshot, according to an eyewitness, set the people in the area scampering to safety in different directions,” adding that before security operatives could arrive at the area, the gunmen had zoomed off.

Police discover bomb factory in Minna

A surveillance by the Niger State police command, on Saturday night, led to the discovery of an impoverished explosive devices (IEDs) manufacturing factory in Maitun-mbi quarters, suspected to belong to the Boko Haram, on the outskirts of Minna.

A team of detectives, acting on a tip-off by one of the five suspects arrested in connection with the murder of three policemen attached to the command last week, stormed the bomb factory located behind a private school in the area at about 8.30 p.m.

Nigerian Tribune further gathered that the raid, which lasted for about two hours, led to the recovery of two 1.5gms gas cylinder cans already prepared for explosion.

Other weapons allegedly found in the house, it was learnt, included 30 cans of disposable food beverage and soft drinks also stockpiled with explosives, 25 kilogrammes of fertiliser, batteries, remote control devices and other electrical gadgets.

Further checks, however, revealed that unspecified numbers of the sect members were arrested in connection with the raid on Sunday evening.

When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Pius Edorbo, refused to give details on the raid, but promised to issue a statement on the matter later.

Meanwhile, a manhunt for the suspected sect members was ongoing by a joint military team at Maitunmbi, Bosso Local Government Area and Tunga communities in Chanchaga Local Government Area of the state at the time of filing this report on Sunday.

""About 30 suspected Boko Haram terrorists were killed in the battle which lasted several hours,"" Lieutenant Eli Lazarus, an army spokesman, said in a statement on Sunday.

Troops of the Joint Task Force (JTF) ""engaged in a gun battle with the suspected terrorists"" during a search-and-cordon operation on Boko Haram's hideout in Kandahar and around cemetery areas of Damaturu, the state capital, the statement said.

Ten suspected members of the group who were arrested during the raid are helping investigators to track other senior members of the group, added the statement.

Six rifles, 90 rounds of ammunition, several telephone sets were recovered during the raid. Knives, bows, arrows, daggers and three improvised explosive devices, which were detonated, were also confiscated, Lazarus said.

Patrick Egbuniwe, Yobe state police chief, said earlier on Sunday that troops shot dead four suspected members of the armed group following a raid on their hideout in Kandahar.

""We carried out the raid because of the incessant ambush on JTF patrol teams by Boko Haram gunmen in the area,"" he said.

Islamist extremists have been blamed for more than 1,400 deaths since 2010 as part of their attacks in northern and central Nigeria.

The JTF statement commended the support of Yobe residents and urged to give more information that will lead to the arrest of more suspected Boko Haram members.

""JTF further requests that people should remain calm and go about their lawful activities as efforts are geared towards ensuring the safety of lives and property,"" added the statement.

Last month in Damaturu, the military said it killed 35 suspected Boko Haram members in fierce gun battles. Some 60 people were also arrested there following a door-to-door sweep in several neighbourhoods.

A number of security personnel have also been arrested over links to Boko Haram.

The arrests came after JTF soldiers in the northeastern city of Maiduguri arrested an immigration officer, Grema Mohammed, for allegedly being an active member of the group, a military spokesman had said.

The JTF is a special unit made up of troops drawn from the armed forces, the police and the state security service."

Soldiers on patrol at blast scene in Maiduguri.

Maiduguri — At least 30 civilians and insurgents were killed in Maiduguri yesterday when security operatives allegedly went berserk after the killing of an Army lieutenant and six other military personnel in an explosion.

Witnesses said the violence was triggered by a ""thunderous blast"" which hit a military patrol van at about 7.15am along Lagos Street in the Borno State capital, which has seen deadly Boko Haram uprising for the past three years.

Soon after the blast in which the military personnel were killed, angry soldiers opened fire and set ablaze over 100 houses and shops, as well as 35 vehicles. Gwange, an adjoining settlement of the less privileged, was worst affected, witnesses said.

Spokesman for the Joint Task Force (JTF), Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, confirmed that there was a blast but said only two soldiers sustained injuries.

He declined to comment on the allegation of mass killing of civilians and burning of homes, shops and vehicles.

""There was a bomb blast involving a JTF Hilux vehicle at 7.15am today (yesterday) along Lagos Street in Maiduguri metropolis. It is feared that 2 soldiers sustained injury. Details on the incident, if any, will be communicated,"" Musa said in a text message sent to journalists.

Baba Karami, who works at a nearby car-wash platform, said the impact of the explosion tore the patrol vehicle of the JTF operatives and the soldiers in it.

""Our platform is less than 150 metres away from the scene...I even fell because of fear. Black smoke and dust soon enveloped the sky and after some time, I counted the bodies of six soldiers on the ground. This was after we took cover in a nearby shop,"" he said.

He said some people were trapped inside their homes while fires raged. ""If you get into Gwange, you will also see some burnt cars in front of burnt houses,"" he added.

Another witness, Usman Sanusi, who was taking his son to school when the blast happened, said he saw two military pickup vans, water tanker and an ambulance heading towards the scene of the blast which was already cordoned.

""We were forced to take a detour and before I got to my destination. I saw smoke billowing around Gwange area,"" he said.

Sources at the State Specialists Hospital and the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital said many corpses have been deposited in their mortuaries.

""The atrocities going on in Maiduguri is worse than what obtains in Somalia. People are being killed and their wealth destroyed by the soldiers. Today, even new cars displayed for sales have been vandalised...We want them to go, we prefer to be killed by the terrorists,"" a resident said.

Our correspondents report that a shopping mall and some shops attached to the state NUJ secretariat were also burnt.

Yesterday's attack on the JTF was the deadliest in recent times. About nine days ago, a bomb was ignited remotely on the same Lagos Street reportedly killing two soldiers.

Businesses were paralyzed on the street after yesterday's incident, while students who were on their way to the University of Maiduguri and patients heading to the Teaching Hospital had to look for alternative routes.

Borno State deputy governor Zannah Umar Mustapha who visited the area sympathised with the people affected.

He promised government's assistance to the affected families as soon as Governor Kashim Shettima returns from official engagement abroad.

""We would continue to plead with the aggrieved members in our society to lay down their arms. There is nothing like peace,"" Mustapha said.

No group claimed responsibility for planting the bomb that killed the soldiers, which apparently sparked more killings.

In nearby Yobe State, the Police on Sunday said 30 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in fighting with the Joint Task Force."

This came as the Chairman of the PDP in the state, Chief Adebayo Dayo, alleged threat to his life by unknown persons on Monday.

The protesting PDP members stormed the secretariat on the Presidential Boulevard, Abeokuta as early as 7.30am carrying placards with such inscriptions as ‘we say no to Jankara politics,’ ‘Oyinlola, allow peace to reign in Ogun PDP’, ‘Obasanjo, stop destroying PDP because of your godson’, and ‘Enough is enough’.

The Senator Oladipo Odujinrin-led executive of the party which, is said to be loyal to Obasanjo had on Friday forcibly taken over the secretariat from the Dayo-led exco.

The protesters were however stopped from entering the secretariat when about 10 suspected hoodlums carrying pump action and double barrel guns, threatened to shoot them if they attempted to enter the premises.

Following this, journalists and security operatives, who had also gathered at the secretariat had to scamper to safety.

Addressing the protesters, the Deputy Chairman of the party in the state, Chief Sola Soledolu, said the Dayo-led group was determined to take over the running of the secretariat from the Obasanjo faction.

Soledolu urged them not resort to violence in taking back the building.

He, however, added that the suspected thugs had allegedly demanded N5m as a pre-condition for them to leave the secretariat.

He said, “We were here to hold our monthly meeting at the party secretariat but unfortunately, we met some hoodlums in the secretariat, carrying guns. I’ve never seen where law and order are not the order of the day. It’s only in Ogun State that you can see that. I believe you journalists have seen them and captured them carrying guns and trying to shoot our people.

“They have again denied us entry into the secretariat. This secretariat belongs to no particular persons but the PDP in Ogun State.

“We have been holding our meetings here but just last Tuesday, before we got here, we didn’t know how they managed to force our gates open, beat up our securitymen and took over the secretariat. When we investigated, we realised that these people were put in there by Bode Mustapha, the one claiming to be the national auditor of the party.

“We are not here to fight, we believe in justice. We have seen that these thugs were hired to destabilise the party in Ogun State. We have the court judgements that recognise the Dayo-led exco as the authentic PDP in Ogun State.

“These hoodlums in the secretariat are asking for N5m before leaving. And we say no. We are not giving money to anybody. If they don’t want to leave, they can remain there. The structure is our own and the party belongs to everybody.”

Dayo in a telephone interview with our correspondent however alleged threat to his life, saying four unknown men trailed him from Abeokuta of the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ikemefuna Okoye, on Monday, to Isara.

The PDP chairman also accused the police commissioner of bias in the handling of the seizure of the secretariat by thugs.

Dayo said: “They have made up their minds. There is no reason for the commissioner of police to tell us to go court. I’m just hiding somewhere in a friend’s house now. Four people in a car trailed my vehicle as I left the commissioner of police office. The police is biased, they have made up their minds. I have written three petitions to the police, SSS and the Zone 2.”"

Tsafe, who addressed newsmen about 8pm on Tuesday, stressed that the command had not deployed any of its men to the secretariat.

He added that the command would ensure that order was maintained in the state.

He said: “I want to assure you that the police were not there at the secretariat. We’ll ensure that Abeokuta is safe and I’m very sure there was no fracas anywhere in Abeokuta.

Ugwu was reportedly shot dead by two young men who stormed his shop at Akpoga Nike at about 7.30pm Tuesday.

The gunmen were said to have shot at him several times and left him in a pool of his own blood, and escaped immediately without removing anything from the shop.

The royal father who was popularly called Ode 1 of Umuode, had occupied the chieftaincy stool for over 10 years.

Sources said he was rushed to the Annunciation Hospital, Emene, Enugu by some of his relations who rushed from his community after they were alerted of the incident, but he was only confirmed dead by the doctors on duty. His body has been deposited at the hospital's morgue.

Igwe Ugwu's Umuode community from where the immediate past Minister of Power, Professor Barth Nnaji hails, had been at war with their Oruku neighbours since the past eight years.

The two communities engaged in random shooting of guns recently apparently to signal another round of hostility but security operatives deployed to the area later calmed the tension.

Following the assassination, tension has heightened among natives of Umuode community in Nkanu East local government area of Enugu State, following the assassination of their traditional ruler, Igwe Moses Ugwu Tuesday night.

Their Oruku neighbours were also said to be apprehensive and vigilant to ensure that the death of the royal father did not lead to another round of hostility between them and Umuode natives, who had been locked in a communal feud for over 20 years.

Enugu State Police command said over 20 persons had been arrested, while investigations had commenced to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of the monarch. The police raided Akpoga Nike where the incident occurred as well as Onuogba Nike, a neighbouring community where the suspects were arrested for questioning."

This is just as Lucy was buried amid tears at Etinan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State on Saturday.

PUNCH Metro had reported on Friday that the police authorities had pleaded with the family to accept an amicable settlement of the matter.

But Lucy’s uncle, Tony Ukpong, who spoke with our correspondent in Etinan on Saturday, insisted that the family was more interested in justice.

Although he acknowledged that the police had made entreaties to the family, he said family members were still meeting and had yet to decide whether to dialogue with the police authorities or not.

Tony said, “Justice must be done because the way Lucy was killed is not acceptable to us; we demand justice and nothing less.

“We have no demand but we want to go into a dialogue. We have not stated any of our demands. Negotiation is ongoing within the family that is the best I can tell you.”

Meanwhile, the National Coordinator, Greater Gbagyi Development Initiative, Gbaiza Gimba, has said the organisation will not allow the matter to be swept under the carpet.

Gimba, who spoke with our correspondent after the burial, said the group took interest in the matter in line with its principle that justice must be done to aggrieved parties.

“We believe that Lucy died for justice. We shall be ready to give her justice. Whatever the situation, we will be talking with our leaders, our traditional institutions in making sure that justice is done to ameliorate the suffering of the son that she left behind,” he said.

He blamed police brutality on bad leadership, adding that the leaders had abdicated their responsibility.

Gimba observed that in developed countries, policemen use rubber bullets to disperse crowd during civil unrest, wondering why the Nigeria Police always use live bullets to disperse protesters.

He said, “In crisis, police were supposed to go with teargas, but because there is no control over issues by the government, that is why anything can happen in this country.

“If police are shooting, they might be telling us that they are shooting to defend themselves, but it is not within our power to say this is how it should go. We will continue to make sure that the right things are done for justice to be given to whom it is taken away from.”

A sympathiser, Okon Tom, said the killing had also shown that the police were not for the masses but for the rich and privileged members of the society.

He called on civil society groups to ensure that justice was done to Lucy by identifying and bringing the killers to justice.

Lucy, a sales girl at a photography shop, was hit in the chest by bullets fired by policemen from the FTC Special Anti-robbery Squad on October 12. She had only spent one month on her job before the incident.

The policemen claimed they had come to enforce the order on demolition of illegal structures by officials of the development control department of Abuja Metropolitan Council.

But the policemen, according to findings, were on illegal duty as the council had denied sending them to enforce the order.

Lucy’s remains were buried on Saturday at 1.13pm at her family’s compound on Udo Inyang Street, Etinan. Apart from her parents, she also left a son, Devine Godswill, behind."

Two people were killed in Rakung in Riyom, while another two were killed in Gurando near Kura Falls; all the incidents happening simultaneously in the wee hours of Saturday.

The latest incident brings to more than 20, the number of people killed since last Wednesday in Riyom and Barakin Ladi local councils in a fratricidal violence that had pitted the Fulani herdsmen against their Berom hosts.

Saturday killings came on the heels of heightened tension in Riyom on Friday, when more than 2000 women of Berom extraction took to the streets to protest the killing of a woman by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.

The woman was allegedly waylaid and killed on her way to the farm. Her death was said to be a reprisal for Wednesday’s killing of a Fulani man by some suspected Berom youths.

Weekend travellers to and fro Abuja were stranded for many hours as the women blocked the road.

Inspector General of police, Muhammed Abubakar

There was confusion in Kaduna on Saturday when a policeman allegedly killed a printer.

The victim, Elisha Joseph, 40, according to an eyewitness, was said to be making peace between a policeman and a prisons official (their identities could not be ascertained at press time) involved in a traffic offence.

The development forced hundreds of youths to barricade the Lagos Roundabout and all entrances leading to Magaji Garin Police Station, protesting the death of the printer.

Commuters, commercial motorcyclists and residents of the area scampered for safety thinking it was another crisis while youths displayed green leaves, demanding immediate justice over the killing of Joseph.

Our correspondent gathered that trouble started at about 1pm when a prisons official and a police man were arguing about their rights on the road.

It was learnt that both of them were driving in opposite directions along the Forcados/Bonny streets in the heart of the city; just as both of them claimed to be on the right lane.

While an argument ensued between them, the deceased reportedly left his shop and went to meet both men. He was said to have admonished the prisons official and the police man to calm down as they were both security men.

Infuriated by Joseph’s comment, the policeman reportedly asked the printer who made him a judge over the case and hit the printer on the stomach and head repeatedly.

The eye-witness who pleaded anonymity said, “After hitting him, the policeman dragged Joesph into his vehicle. People were shouting that the policeman should leave him alone. He left him and the deceased, stood up and went to the hospital for a check-up. He died in the hospital”

When contacted, the Kaduna State Commissioner of Police, Olufemi Adenaike simply said, “As a journalist, go and do your investigation very well, no policeman beat him, no policeman hit him, he was foaming in the mouth, I think he is diabetic. He took himself to the hospital and died there.”

Father of the deceased, Mr. Kunle Joseph said, “I am devastated over the death of my son, and as at the time of talking to you, I have not seen the body. I am presently in a state of confusion. There is no action that will bring him back to life but we want justice to be done.”"

Human rights lawyer, Mr. Bamidele Aturu

Prominent lawyers, Prof. Itse Sagay, Mr. Bamidele Aturu, and the Legal Defence and Assistance Project have called for the prosecution of security personnel involved in recent extrajudicial killings in Lagos State.

While reacting to the increasing reports of extra-judicial killings in the state, Sagay, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, decried the manner in which security operatives, who should protect lives, have been involved in illegal killings.

He said, “Extrajudicial killing is always a major offence. I rank it as a crime against humanity. It is an illegal execution. Policemen are becoming unreliable and untrustworthy by taking lives instead of protecting them. We no longer trust the police.

“The Inspector-General and the commissioners have to clamp down on their officials so as to have a police force that will protect and not kill us.”

Similarly, Aturu, a human rights lawyer, berated security agencies for the killings, adding that the trend would continue if left unchecked.

He said, “The extrajudicial killings are unlawful, unconstitutional, wicked, indefensible and an act of lawlessness. The people who should protect lives are now taking lives and that is immoral.”

The National Coordinator, LEDAP, Mr. Chino Obiagwu, also told our correspondent that the enforcement of the new Lagos Road Traffic Law had led to an abuse of power by the security agents and manhandling of traffic offenders.

He said, “Unfortunately, nobody monitors the implementation of the law. some people have either been shot or killed in the last few months and nobody is being prosecuted for these extrajudicial killings. “In advanced countries, motorcycles have their lanes but Lagos has none.”

On November 10, an employee of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Femi Badejo, and his security guard, Joshua Moses, were shot by policemen in Lagos, who were responding to a distress call.

Badejo, who later had four out of five bullets in his body removed at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos Island, said he and his neighbours were in the compound discussing how the armed robbers attacked their home in Ikota, when the policemen stormed the building and started shooting sporadically.

On November 7, a policeman, Oluwatiyesi Gboyega, attached to the Alapere Police Division, Ketu, Lagos, allegedly shot and killed a bus conductor at Tipper Bus Stop during an argument over N50.

Also on November 6, a policeman identified as Yemi allegedly shot an Okada rider, Adigun Atilola, in Ilupeju area of Lagos State, while trying to enforce the new state traffic law.

It was gathered that Yemi, who was in company with five other officers, allegedly shot Atilola when he attempted to evade arrest at Teju Junction, Ilupeju.

Earlier on October 17, a policeman attached to Ago Police Division, Okota, Lagos, allegedly shot two men, Adebisi Adewole and Gbenga Abiodun, at GKS Bus Stop, Ago Palace Road, for attempting to intervene in the arrest of commercial motorcycle riders plying restricted routes by some policemen.

Similarly, on October 23, an unidentified policeman from Pen Cinema Police Division, Agege, Lagos State, allegedly killed an Okada rider identified simply as Omo Saki, after hitting him with a baton on the head on Oba Ogunnusi Road, Ogba.

It would be recalled that five days after his wedding to Joan, 36-year-old Ugochukwu Ozuah, was on September 20, 2012, allegedly killed by policemen attached to the Anthony Division.

It was learnt that five policemen were arrested and under interrogation by the Federal Criminal Investigation Department constituted by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar.

When contacted, Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, told SUNDAY PUNCH that the agency was investigating all the cases, adding that it would handle them with fairness.

He said, “All the cases are under investigation. If at the end of the investigation anyone is found culpable, the force will ensure proper prosecution. Such cases have been reported and we have always been fair in handling them.”"

Vanguard learnt that one of the explosions destroyed the pulpit of the COCIN Church in Zango and a building near the church while the second explosion destroyed a fence in Gudum Sayawa. There were no casualties in both explosions.

Vanguard learnt that the bomb planted in the pulpit of the COCIN church in Zango exploded at about 9pm Tuesday, almost at the same time with the one that exploded in Gudum Hausawa.

""The explosion occurred few minutes after they left, taking the two security men in the church by surprise,"" the man who pleaded anonymity told Vanguard.

No life was lost in the two explosions but the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Lawi Pokti said the development had sent fear and panic among residents particularly Christians in the state.

Pokti called on Christians to remain calm and watch what they say and not imitate ""this increasing evil and wickedness"" just as he appealed to the security operatives to be proactive in handling the current insecurity in the state.

4 die in bus attack

Meanwhile, some people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen have attacked a bus killing four people, yesterday, in Gwatukuru village near Dass Local Government Area in Bauchi State.

Nine people were seriously injured after the bus with number plate AA 82 TFB belonging to the Seyawa Council of Elders and Traditional Rulers was set ablaze.

Mr Bukata Zyadi, Secretary of the Sayawa Council of Elders, said the victims were burnt to ashes while the injured had been taken to hospitals in Plateau State and some in Dass.

He said four of the injured were rushed to Jos, five are undergoing surgery in Dass General Hospital, seven in emergency unit in Dass general hospital emergency unit while two are safe.

Zyadi said the attack was carried out by the ""Hausa-Fulani people, one of their normal attacks that have been happening almost on a daily basis in Tafawa Balewa and Bogoro Local Government Area.""

He said peace would continue to elude the area because the state government has shown bias and that ""security has completely broken down as the presence of the JTF in the area has not stopped the killings.""

But Honourable Amin Tukur, a spokesman of the Fulani in the area condemned the recent killing saying that as a responsible citizen, whosoever is believed to have carried out the killings stands to be condemned."

The Action Congress of Nigeria on Saturday accused the Labour Party of exploiting the inadequate security in Indanre, Ondo State to scare away ACN voters.

In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Lai Mohammed, the party said armed thugs attacked the party’s agents and intimidated its supporters, especially in the rural areas.

“If those saddled with the responsibility of providing adequate security are unable to do so, and many voters are disenfranchised because of that, then the election in the area cannot be adjudged free and fair.

“If thugs acting in support of the LP are given a free rein and voters of the ACN are scared away from the polling units, the election in the area cannot be adjudged to be credible on the grounds of technical exclusion.

“It is the responsibility of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agents to ensure that every voter has access to the polling units,” the ACN said."

Armed robbers attacked a Church House in Ogun State on Monday killing three cops who tried to prevent their escape.

The 15-man robbery gang invaded the Apostolic Church Mission House, Ijemo-Agbadu area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State Capital, at about 1.45a.m.

Three cops of the Ogun State Police Command, who engaged the robbers in a gun duel for about 45minutes, were killed; while two others were injured.

The robbers were said to be acting on information that a huge sum of money was kept in the mission house. While some reports state that the robbers, who jumped over the church fence to launch the attack, made away with money; another report states that the robbers could not locate the church fund.

The robbers, after gaining access to the premises, destroyed the burglary proof and ransacked the building, residents said.

Police sources said that while the robbery operation was going, the Rapid Response Squad of the police, led by two inspectors, got a distress call, and raced to the scene.

The bandits engaged the cops in a gun battle, killing three of them including the two Inspectors. Two other policemen were injured and have been admitted at Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta.

The activities of the robbers caused many houses in the area to be riddled with bullets. Three vehicles parked on the roadside were also damaged with bullets. Some of the occupants of the church house said the attack was the third carried out by the robbers on the mission.

The Pastor of the Church, Jacob Adeotan, told PREMIUM TIMES that the robbers held residents hostage while the operation lasted.

Mr. Adeotan, who conducted our correspondent round the compound, said the gang, numbering about 15, scaled the fence of the church before their violent operations

“As you can see, they broke the burglary proof, gained access into many apartments before ransacking,” the pastor said. “They operated for about 45 minutes, and engaged in sporadic shooting when police patrol team arrived.”

The Spokesperson for the Ogun State Police Command, Muyiwa Adejobi, said about 300 used pellets was recovered. He said efforts were on to get the bandits, and called on members of the public to assist with information.

The Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, has reportedly visited the two admitted policemen at Federal Medical Centre, Abeokuta. Commissioner of Police, Ikemefuna Okoye, accompanied him.

Meanwhile, the corpses of the three policemen have been deposited at the morgue of the State Hospital, Sokenu, Abeokuta.

Insecurity in Nigeria.

Damaturu — The violence rocking Potiskum worsened yesterday with the killing of several soldiers, a senior government officer and his two children, as well as burning of three key colleges and homes of two Federal officials.

Potiskum, the largest city in restive Yobe State, has been plagued by intermittent Boko Haram-linked violence for months now. The latest wave of bloodshed began late last week and spiralled over the past days.

Residents said gunmen launched coordinated attacks around 2am yesterday, in which they slaughtered the Director of Finance and Supply at the Yobe State Science and Technical Board, Malam Ado Jespa, along with his two children and neighbor Sagir at their homes in T-Junction area of Potiskum.

They also attacked and razed the homes of a House of Representatives member Abubakar Mainasara and Customs area comptroller in charge of Katsina/Kaduna, Alhaji Yusuf Umar.

Elsewhere in Potiskum, the King Abdulazeez Model Islamic School, Government Science Secondary School and College of Administration Potiskum (CAPs), one of the surviving legacies of the late Sir Ahmadu Bello, were razed along with 18 vehicles.

A security guard in the lawmaker's house, another guard at the Customs comptroller's house, a barber living nearby and a staff of CAPs known as Malam Alfa were killed during the attacks.

A witness described the attack on the lawmaker's home, which he said happened at about 2am: ""They asked us to get them petrol or kerosine, which they mixed with gun powder and set the house ablaze. In the morning we discovered that a security guard was slaughtered there.""

The BBC News website reported that ""several"" soldiers were killed in the violence. ""Some of our men died during the attack, but the rule is that their families have to be notified first before it is announced,"" the BBC quoted an unnamed security source as saying.

JTF spokesman Eli Lazarus told Daily Trust yesterday they were aware of attacks in different parts of the city but did not mention casualty figures.

""We are aware of most of these attacks, and advised the state government to impose curfew in order to curb the crimes, which they did,"" he said.

A spokesman for Governor Ibrahim Gaidam confirmed that a 15-hour curfew has been declared in Potiskum.

""Governor Ibrahim Gaidam has approved the imposition of restriction of movement in Potiskum town beginning from today Monday 22nd October 2012 from 4.00pm to 7.00am daily,"" said Abdullahi Bego, the governor's special adviser on press affairs and information.

""The measure is designed to ensure the protection of life and property and the maintenance of law and order.

""The governor urges all Potiskum residents to cooperate with security agents as they continue in their effort to ensure peace and security in Potiskum and around the state."""

The Okada riders in the state continued their protest yesterday at Kola Bus Stop, on Lagos-Abeokuta Express way, damaging a LAGBUS bus.

Similar incident happened at Ikotun Ejigbo Road as Okada riders blocked the major highway with burning tyres to register their displeasure over what they termed indiscriminate arrests and extortion by men of the Nigeria police and the new road traffic law banning their activities from 475 roads in the state.

It would be recalled that the Okada riders on Monday, resorted to violent protest across the state, vandalising Bus Rapid Transit, (BRT) and LAGBUS buses operating on Ikorodu Road.

According to an eyewitness who identified himself as Rasaq, the late Okada rider was hit by the men of the RRS at Pen Cinema while trying to escape with his motorcycle from being impounded by the security officers.

Rasaq, who spoke in Yoruba,narrated: ""As the Okada rider was trying to evade arrest from the police, he quickly diverted his motorcycle towards Ogba-Ijaiye Housing Estate. The men of the RRS also did not retreat, they continued the chase. During the process, one of the police officers hit the rider with his baton and he collapsed immediately.

""On seeing his helpless body on the ground, operators of tricycles, popularly called ""keke NAPEP,"" quickly rushed him to the nearest hospital.""

The protesters chanted anti-war songs and increased their activities to adjoining bus stops on the axis.

According to another eyewitness, Mr. Godwin Udofia, the situation began as early as 9:00 am with the protesters armed with stones and other equipment.

The scabs among the operators who did not join in the protest were also attacked with stones.

The situation resulted in hundreds of commuters being stranded at different bus stops, as heavy traffic gridlock was experienced on the ever busy Ikorodu Road.

...ACN reactsMeantime,

the state chapter of the Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, has appealed to residents not to allow themselves to be used by desperate politicians to cause chaos in the state in the name of protesting against the ban of commercial motorcycle operations in some parts of Lagos.

The party made this appeal in the wake of the attacks on government vehicles and properties by people masquerading as commercial motorcycle operators.

The party urged law enforcement agencies to deal with those destroying government properties on the pretext of protesting ban on Okada operations.

In a release by the party's Publicity Secretary, Joe Igbokwe, the ban on Okada operators was done in the best interests of the people at heart."

Former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose

| credits:

Former Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose and the ruling Action Congress of Nigeria engaged in war of words over the violence that reportedly left about six persons injured and vehicles vandalised in Oye Ekiti on Monday.

Fayose is a leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state.

Our correspondent learnt that dangerous weapons were used when persons believed to be the supporters of ACN and those of Fayose clashed, despite heavy presence of policemen.

The Director-General of Ayo Fayose Campaign Organisation, Mr. Gboyega Oguntuase, told reporters in Afao Ekiti that the PDP were holding a meeting when hoodlums he claimed were ACN supporters attacked them.

He said six members of the party were injured while four vehicles belonging to them were vandalised.

Oguntuase said, “They have been laying siege to us for a long time. If the attacks continue, they are inviting a state of emergency.”

However, the Director of Publicity of the ACN in the state, Chief Tai Oguntayo, denied the allegation.

He said the ACN supporters were not involved in the attack, blaming Fayose for the crisis.

He said the attack could be as a result of an intra-party crisis in the PDP.

The ACN chief said both parties had been in the town for a along time without any fight.

Oguntayo said, “The ACN is not known for violence. Why is it that the violence happened today when Fayose went to Oye Ekiti.”

Efforts to get comments from the police were unsuccessful as calls put across to the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Sotonye Wakama, by our correspondent were not answered. Also, the text message sent to him was not acknowledged.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Victor Babayemi, could not be reached on telephone as his line was switched off."

Four armed men on Monday robbed and killed a middle-aged car dealer, Chief Emeka Ekwerendu, at Modebe Avenue Junction in the commercial city of Onitsha, Anambra State.

The Divisional Police Officer at the Central Police Station, Onitsha, Mr. Tomitope Fahugbe, confirmed the incident to newsmen, adding that he had yet to receive full details.

An eyewitness said the late Ekwerendu was shot by a four-man armed robbery gang at about 8:30a.m a few metres away from the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, Odoakpu, Onitsha.

“The gang operating in a light green Toyota Sienna without a vehicle number plate trailed their victim from a primary school close to the church, after he had dropped his children at school.

“As he was driving out in his black Land Cruiser jeep, he was shot dead and an undisclosed amount of money taken from the boot of his vehicle.

“The gang armed with four Ak-47 riffle shot sporadically into the air to scare the people away as they made their exit,” he said."

Hoodlums on Wednesday evening invaded the palace of Alasa of Ilasa-Ekiti destroying the palace and carting away artifacts in including crowns and staff of office.

The Regent in the town, Amb. Jolaade Onipede, who was installed as the Regent on Tuesday, told journalists on the telephone on Thursday that the hoodlums, led by some government officials, brutalised the policeman attached to her.

She stated that two government officials holding guns in their hands led the hoodlums who invaded the palace and vandalized it beyond recognition.

Barely 24 hours after Onipede was installed, the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Funminiyi Afuye, announced Mrs. Comfort Dayo Idowu, as the “rightful and lawful Regent for the town.”

Onipede, while reacting to the announcement of the new Regent, said that she would not vacate her father’s throne for Idowu.

She stated that although the hoodlums did not attack her, they invaded the room of Olori and catered away money and other valuable items to complete their mission.

Onipede, who is the current Nigerian Ambassador to Republic of Congo, accused the state government of being behind the attack.

She said, “ I was about to address some students when a heard gun shots. I saw two government officials (name withheld) each of them was holding two guns and they shot sporadically.

“Although I was not attacked, but the policeman attached to me was brutalised. They beat those they saw and attacked them with machetes. If the state government is the one orchestrating violence then the state is in trouble.”

However, the commissioner for information denied the allegation, saying it was a deliberate falsehood fabricated to embarrass the government.

Afuye said the state government knew nothing about the invasion of the palace.

The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Mr. Makanjuola Ogundipe, who also accused the state government of being behind the envoy’s travail, said the responsibility of appointing a Regent was that of the traditional institution.

Efforts to get police to confirm the attack on the palace were not successful."

Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police for Oyo State Command, Mr. Joseph Mbu has assured of a 'new Operation Burst' in the state during a remedial visit of Governor Abiola Ajimobi to the state police command on Monday evening.

Explosions and gunshots were reported on Tuesday in Gashua, a town in Yobe State (North-East Nigeria).

Although details of casualties and level of destruction were not available, soldiers attached to the Joint Task Force on Operation Restore Order were swiftly deployed in the town, which hosts a well known prison.

“There have been explosions and gunfire throughout the town. It all began around 3a.m and lasted up to 6a.m in the morning,” one resident told Agence France Presse.

The town has suffered attacks from the violent Boko Haram sect in the past, although it could not be confirmed if it was behind the lastest attack.

JTF spokesman in Yobe State, Lazarus Eli, confirmed soldiers were patrolling, but declined to give further details.

“Our troops have deployed to Gashua this morning, but I can’t tell you the situation in the town now,” he said.

Violence has continued across some cities in North-East Nigeria in spite of an offer by Boko Haram to open talks with the Federal Government, as part of a proposed ceasefire.

Also, the police station at Kuola, Apata, five vehicles and seven motorcycles were torched by the aggrieved okada riders who complained bitterly about alleged high-handedness of the policemen in the area.

The melee which lasted about three hours sacked Apata and its environs.

According to eyewitness account, the crisis ensued when an okada rider allegedly violated a police directive that banned them from carrying two passengers.

The culprit was promptly arrested and taken to the police station.

Disatisfied by the arrest of their colleague, about 45 okada riders mobilized themselves and stormed the police station demanding the release of their colleague.

Vanguard gathered that the okada riders then started hauling stones and other objects at the station.

In a twinkle of an eye, the station was set ablaze.

Consequently, ten police Hilux vans loaded with armed policemen and soldiers, one armoured personnel carrier, APC were sent to the area.

Police then arrested 30 okada riders and took to the Oyo State Criminal Investigation Department.

Speaking on the incident, one of the community leaders, Engr. Ayodele Olowoyile said the police should not be blamed because due to incessant robbery attacks, landlords in the area had pleaded with the police to prevent Okada riders from gaining entry into the community but stop at the expressway. In addition, the police have been mandated to arrest any okada man who carried two passengers.

However, A university don blamed the police for the crisis. To him, there should be adequate sensitization that would enlighten the okada riders.

While the crisis lasted, journalists were barred from taking photographs.

A photographer who had taken some pictures was forced by the police to delete it.

He told the newsmen that he was acting on the orders of the Commissioner of police, Mbu Joseph Mbu.

It was observed that the crisis forced policemen to leave the area.

Reacting to the incident, the Acting Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ayodele Lanade said policemen were trying to rescue an okada rider who fell down.

This was probably misunderstood by the okada riders who reacted violently. He said nobody died in the incident.

He said, 48 okada riders have been arrested."

Although, the cause was yet to be ascertained, it was gathered that the victim was allegedly shot dead by policemen attached to the Ketu Police Division.

Meanwhile, THISDAY gathered that the commercial motorcyclist who was shot on Tuesday at Ilupeju died yesterday due to loss of blood.

The incident has brought the total number of commercial motorcyclists so far shot by the police in two weeks to five, thereby raising fears of a volatile protest by the riders.

The last time the riders protested in the city, about three Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) were destroyed.

Attempts to confirm the latest killing from the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ngozi Braide, proved abortive.

Human rights lawyer, Mr. Bamidele Aturu

| credits: File copy

Prominent lawyers, Prof. Itse Sagay, Mr. Bamidele Aturu, and the Legal Defence and Assistance Project have called for the prosecution of security personnel involved in recent extrajudicial killings in Lagos State.

While reacting to the increasing reports of extra-judicial killings in the state, Sagay, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, decried the manner in which security operatives, who should protect lives, have been involved in illegal killings.

He said, “Extrajudicial killing is always a major offence. I rank it as a crime against humanity. It is an illegal execution. Policemen are becoming unreliable and untrustworthy by taking lives instead of protecting them. We no longer trust the police.

“The Inspector-General and the commissioners have to clamp down on their officials so as to have a police force that will protect and not kill us.”

Similarly, Aturu, a human rights lawyer, berated security agencies for the killings, adding that the trend would continue if left unchecked.

He said, “The extrajudicial killings are unlawful, unconstitutional, wicked, indefensible and an act of lawlessness. The people who should protect lives are now taking lives and that is immoral.”

The National Coordinator, LEDAP, Mr. Chino Obiagwu, also told our correspondent that the enforcement of the new Lagos Road Traffic Law had led to an abuse of power by the security agents and manhandling of traffic offenders.

He said, “Unfortunately, nobody monitors the implementation of the law. some people have either been shot or killed in the last few months and nobody is being prosecuted for these extrajudicial killings. “In advanced countries, motorcycles have their lanes but Lagos has none.”

On November 10, an employee of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Femi Badejo, and his security guard, Joshua Moses, were shot by policemen in Lagos, who were responding to a distress call.

Badejo, who later had four out of five bullets in his body removed at St. Nicholas Hospital, Lagos Island, said he and his neighbours were in the compound discussing how the armed robbers attacked their home in Ikota, when the policemen stormed the building and started shooting sporadically.

On November 7, a policeman, Oluwatiyesi Gboyega, attached to the Alapere Police Division, Ketu, Lagos, allegedly shot and killed a bus conductor at Tipper Bus Stop during an argument over N50.

Also on November 6, a policeman identified as Yemi allegedly shot an Okada rider, Adigun Atilola, in Ilupeju area of Lagos State, while trying to enforce the new state traffic law.

It was gathered that Yemi, who was in company with five other officers, allegedly shot Atilola when he attempted to evade arrest at Teju Junction, Ilupeju.

Earlier on October 17, a policeman attached to Ago Police Division, Okota, Lagos, allegedly shot two men, Adebisi Adewole and Gbenga Abiodun, at GKS Bus Stop, Ago Palace Road, for attempting to intervene in the arrest of commercial motorcycle riders plying restricted routes by some policemen.

Similarly, on October 23, an unidentified policeman from Pen Cinema Police Division, Agege, Lagos State, allegedly killed an Okada rider identified simply as Omo Saki, after hitting him with a baton on the head on Oba Ogunnusi Road, Ogba.

It would be recalled that five days after his wedding to Joan, 36-year-old Ugochukwu Ozuah, was on September 20, 2012, allegedly killed by policemen attached to the Anthony Division.

It was learnt that five policemen were arrested and under interrogation by the Federal Criminal Investigation Department constituted by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar.

When contacted, Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, told SUNDAY PUNCH that the agency was investigating all the cases, adding that it would handle them with fairness.

He said, “All the cases are under investigation. If at the end of the investigation anyone is found culpable, the force will ensure proper prosecution. Such cases have been reported and we have always been fair in handling them.”"

Vanguard was informed that soldiers opened fire when villagers who wanted to lynch a suspected ritualist stoned and prevented them from taking away the suspect from the palace of the monarch for interrogation.

In a reprisal attack, irate villagers razed the palace of Ovie of Idjerhe, His Royal Majesty, Erhikevwe I, who, they suspected, invited the soldiers.

A source said: ""Three persons were killed at first, but the death toll increased later, as the youths continued their attack on soldiers.""

Soldiers, however, whisked the embattled monarch away from the palace to save his life.

As at 9.00 am when Vanguard visited Jesse, the palace was still burning.

""Jesse is on fire, soldiers are everywhere, there is tension, nobody knows what is going to happen next. This is disastrous,"" a concerned villager told Vanguard.

The palace itself was a no-go area, as soldiers, who cordoned the bastion, refused our reporter access.

Spokesperson of the Police in Delta State, Mr. Charles Muka, told Vanguard: ""Please, give me some time, we are still gathering information on what happened."".

At about 2.00 pm, Muka called to confirm that three persons were shot dead, one hospitalised and 12 others arrested in connection with the incident, adding that the Police did not shoot anybody.

Trouble supposedly started when the villagers seized a man, suspected to be a ritualist, and brought him to the palace of the king, expecting that he would authorise them to carry out jungle justice on the suspect.

For two weeks running, a source said, ritualists had been on the rampage in the area, killing about nine persons, a development that made the monarch to set up a committee to probe the development.

It was gathered that the villagers mounted a search party and the efforts reportedly paid off when one of the suspected ritualists was nabbed in the bush and brought to the palace.

The monarch, however, resisted the pleas of his people to lynch the suspect and consequently invited security agents to handle the matter.

He urged the people to allow security agents to interrogate the suspect and get more information about the activities of his gang.

His subjects, particularly the youths, were angry that soldiers came to take away the suspect for interrogation and stoned them.

""They tried to stop the soldiers who came lawfully take away the suspect and that made the soldiers to shoot indiscriminately, gunning down about three persons in the first instance, another person later died,"" the source stated.

Hell was let loose in Jesse when the people saw that some persons had been shot dead.

""That was what made them to attack and set the palace ablaze,"" he added.

As at 10.00 am, soldiers had taken over the streets of Jesse, while some of those injured were seen being taken to the hospital for treatment.

ASABA--DELTA State House of Assembly, yesterday, passed a resolution urging the governor, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, to direct the Commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state to move into Jesse and restore order to the troubled community.

Six persons were feared dead in the community and the palace of the monarch was razed by an angry mob over the king's refusal to allow them to lynch a suspected ritualist.

The motion, which was moved under matters of urgent public importance by the member, representing Ethiope West Local Government Area, John Nani, was unanimously adopted by the lawmakers.

He said there was total anarchy in the area because of the incident, adding that the order was to allow for proper investigation.

Majority Leader, Chief Monday Igbuya, Keston Okoro, Dennis Omovie and others, who spoke in favour of the motion, stressed the need for immediate action to avoid a spillover of the crisis.

Officers of the Enugu State Police Command on Wednesday stopped the Senator, representing Enugu East Senatorial District, Senator Gilbert Nnaji, from holding a public hearing on the proposed review of the 1999 Constitution for his constituency.

Just as Nnaji moved to take his seat for the public hearing, a detachment of regular and riot police officers, led by the Divisional Police Officer for Nkanu West, Sampson Ihuaenyi, chased away thousands of his constituents who gathered at Nkanu West Council headquarters, venue of the exercise.

The DPO, who refused promptings from the Senator and his close friends and aides to allow the public hearing to hold, shouted openly, “We are acting on orders from above and this event must not hold here.”

Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ebere Amaraizu, said, “The DPO and his men were at the venue to provide security and maintain law and order.”

Nnaji lamented that the traditional ruler, the clergy, civil society groups and women of the zone who gathered for the exercise were denied the opportunity to make input in the constitution amendment process.

He said, “It is unfortunate that of all the public hearings going on through out the 109 senatorial districts in Nigeria, the one for Enugu East Senatorial District was thwarted. Some council chairmen sabotaged it.”

He accused the Chairman of Nkanu West Local Government Area, Ekene Okenwa, of sabotaging the event.

He said, “Ekene Okenwa has deliberately refused that this hearing should hold here. I discussed with him on Saturday and he agreed that this occasion be held. I don’t know if it is some people in government quarters that decided to stop this public hearing, but there is no problem. I will report back to the Senate.”

Efforts to speak with Okenwa on the development proved abortive, but the state Commissioner for Information, Mr. Chucks Ugwuoke, said the “state government has no hand in the entire thing.”"

Shola Oyeyipo



There was free-for-all at the early hours of Thursday , with a member of the Kogi State House of Assembly losing two of his teeth at the state governor’s residence when a meeting held to find political solution to the leadership crises in the state Assembly ended in a deadlock.

The meeting held at ‘High Ground’, a private residence of the governor, had former governor Ibrahim Idris, the state governor, Captain Idris Wada and all the lawmakers, except the Speaker, Hon. Abdulahi Bello, who was hospitalised in a private hospital in Abuja, in attendance.

It was a follow-up to an earlier mediation meeting held at Ibro Hotel, Abuja last Monday.

The meeting slated for 9.pm eventually started at about 12.20 am.

But inner sources hinted that trouble started when the agenda of the meeting was perceived to have changed, which did not go down well with the pro-speaker Bello lawmakers.

According to a source, who was present at the meeting: “The meeting which was at the instance of the former governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Idris was meant to return the House to status quo ante, but when the meeting started, we suspected foul play and as such, we disagreed with their illegal proposition.”

The proposition, according to the source, was that the Majority Leader, Hon. Yunusa Yakubu, should write a letter of proclamation to the Speaker for endorsement and approval so that the Assembly could seat.

Though that would have nullified the initial impeachment, but the grouse was that the Speaker was to resign honourably at the resumed sitting of the Assembly:

“It was that suggestion that sparked the fight.

“The Minority Leader, Yori Afolabi, stood up to note that the suggestion was wrong and that, Kogi had been in the news for so many wrong reasons and there was every reason to first right the wrong before talking about Speaker Bello’s resignation.

“It was at that point that Hon. Friday Makama, who had been pacing around with a bottle of stout attempted to shut him up and that led to the fight,” the source said further.

It was during the melee, a notable member of the group of 12 lawmakers lost two of his teeth before other lawmakers present could separate the warring lawmakers.

Meanwhile, the elders of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who petitioned President Goodluck Jonathan over the state of affairs in the state have been accused of leaving “precincts of truth and probity to traverse the terrain of outright falsehood in order to vilify the administration.”

The state Commissioner for Information, Hon. Yabagi Bologi, while reacting to the petition circulated in the media, in a press conference yesterday, described the group as: “self-styled Kogi PDP elders, setting aside all known rules of constructive criticism and positive engagement, and in a most unelderly manner chose to attack the credibility of Governor Idris Wada and passed him on as an inept, corrupt and rudderless leader.”

Senator Alex Kadiri; Senator Mohammed Ohiare; former Speaker of the state House of Assembly and former acting governor, Clarence Olafemi; former state PDP Chairman, John Odawun; Air Vice Marshall Salihu Atawodi (rtd) and former governorship aspirant, Dr. Adinoyi Ojo Onukaba, who were all members of the PDP, had listed the under-development of the state, crisis in the State House of Assembly, the looting of state resources and several illegalities and undemocratic practices as holding sway under the Wada administration in a petition they presented to Mr. President.

But, while noting that the group’s move was targeted at bringing the “hardworking leadership of Wada to public ridicule and opprobrium,” Bologi stressed that the issue of the PDP membership of Wada, which was mentioned in the petition, had been a subject of litigation before the courts of the land, “which declared a verdict of not guilty on the governor. Since the court have made a pronouncement on the matter, we do not think it proper for any one to make an issue from it” and that, “the allegation bordering on corruption levelled against the governor is rather generalised and neither here nor there.”

He also argued that Kogi was one of the states paying the highest emolument in the country and that it was not indebted to its work force as stated by the aggrieved party leaders, who called on the President to intervene in the drifting of the state and the PDP under Wada.

Though a number of the lawmakers have openly accused the governor of fanning the ember of discord currently engulfing the House, the Information Commissioner also maintained that on the purported “impeachment of Hon. Abdullahi Bello as Speaker of the state House of Assembly, the state government has said times without number that the crises in the Assembly is purely an internal affair of the lawmakers. The executive have resisted every attempt to take sides in the crises.”"

Seven persons were reportedly injured as some Action Congress of Nigeria members in Ekiti State and supporters of former Governor Ayo Fayose clashed in Ado-Ekiti on Thursday.

Our correspondent gathered that fight broke out between them over the pasting of posters at Irona area of Ado-Ekiti. Fayose’s supporters are of the Peoples Democratic Party.

It was learnt that supporters of the ex-governor, who celebrated 52nd birthday, were going round the town pasting his political posters when they were stopped by a man.

The man, whose name could not be ascertained, was said to have also prevented the ex-governor’s supporters from pasting posters on an uncompleted building next to his house which he claimed was his father’s house.

However, a supporter of Fayose, who identified himself as Ariyo, said they moved away from the area when they were stopped from pasting their posters but some youths, who were armed with weapons, attacked and injured three of them.

But a source, who identified himself as Taye, told our correspondent that Fayose’s supporters insisted on pasting posters on the houses which were owned by ACN members.

He claimed that the PDP supporters attacked the man and other members of the ACN in the area.

The Director-General of the Ayo Fayose Campaign Organisation, Mr. Gboyega Oguntuase, in his reaction to the clash, blamed the attack on the ruling party, saying it was not tolerant of the opposition.

However, the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Funminiyi Afuye, blamed Fayose for the crisis.

He sad the ex-governor had been going round fomenting trouble in the state but added that the case had been reported to security agencies.

According to him, there is an existing law in the state which forbids illegal and indiscriminate pasting of posters.

He said anybody who wanted to paste posters needed to respect the signage law, get the approval of the agency and pay the stipulated amount before going ahead to do so."

Former Special Adviser to the Governor on Health, Mr. Toyin Hamzat

Five men were on Sunday night arrested at the Sagamu area of Ogun State in connection with the assassination of a former chairman of Ikeja Local Government, Lagos State, Mr. Toyin Hamzat.

Hamzat was also a former special adviser on health to Governor Babatunde Fashola.

It was learnt that he had just dropped a female companion when he was killed.

Although the police did not give the names of the arrested suspects, the spokesman for the Ogun State Police Command, Mr. Muyiwa Adejobi, said the estranged husband of Hamzat’s female companion was one of those arrested.

Adejobi said, “Hamzat was shot dead around 9pm on Sunday. According to the report we got, he had just dropped off a female friend when the gunmen ambushed his car and shot him.

“The woman said the vehicle the assailants used was likely to belong to her estranged husband. She also said there was a time the husband visited her and met Hamzat with her.

“The suspects are currently being held at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Eleweran, Abeokuta.”

Adejobi, however, said since investigation had just started, neither the name of Hamzat’s female companion nor the arrested suspects would be released for now.

The PPRO, who described the killing as a “clear case of murder,” said the body of the deceased had been taken to a morgue in Sagamu.

PUNCH Metro learnt that nothing was stolen in the vehicle in which Hamzat was killed fuelling speculation that he might have been assassinated.

A source said the former LG boss was shot in the head.

When one of our correspondents visited a house belonging to Hamzat on Bodlan Street, Ojodu, Lagos on Monday, no family member was seen there as a tenant said the entire house was rented out.

Also, on Monday two policemen were killed at Olodo International Market along Ayetoro Road, Ogun State, by suspected cross border bandits.

Adejobi said the two slain policemen were on patrol when the bandits opened fire on them.

He said the robbers had stormed the market in order to rob the traders of their valuables.

The PPRO, however, said the command would not be deterred in its efforts to rid the state of criminals. Adejobi advised the leaders of the market to continue to cooperate with the police in order to make the area more secure."

In Maiduguri, Borno State capital, the former ANPP boss, Alhaji Tar Kusurambe was killed by unidentified gunmen. Two other persons were killed in Bauchi, even as an explosive planted in the house of a retired police officer at Gudum Sayawa, was successfully defused.

15 gunmen

Vanguard gathered that unknown gunmen, numbering about 15, stormed Gudun Sayawa, a suburb of Bauchi at about 8pm and killed the two persons.

One of the victims, Mrs. Alheri Ayuba, a mother of three, was killed on her way from a neighbourhood, while Iliya Duba was shot dead as he was about to go to bed.

Some residents of the area, however, alleged that the attack was targeted at a retired police officer. The explosive was found atop the roof of the said officer's house.

According to sources, some of the residents of Gudun Sayawa put distressed calls to the anti-bomb squad, which quickly evacuated the explosive.

Some members of the vigilante group in the area, however, claimed that the police reportedly prevented them from pursuing the gunmen with the aim of arresting them in the premises of a company where they hid shortly after the gun attack.

They vowed to retaliate, blaming the Isa Yuguda's administration for failing to address the insecurity challenges experienced in the area, alleging religious intolerance.

9 in Zango

Some weeks ago, nine people were killed in Zango, near Gudun Sayawa, in similar circumstances.

Among hundreds of sympathisers, who stormed the area to see the level of damage, was Director-General Inter-Religious Council, Pastor Kennedy Masau.

Masau, however, condemned the incident, saying it was not only barbaric but uncalled for. He called on the people to be at alert and guard themselves against future occurrence to ensure peace, unity and tranquillity in the state.

Attempts to confirm the incident from the Bauchi State Police Commissioner, Mr. Ladan Mohammed, were futile.

Meanwhile, Kusura-mbe was shot dead at his residence at 2am in Magumeri town, barely two days after returning from Saudi Arabia on the 2012 hajj exercise."

The Agbere community, Sagbama Local Government Area, Bayelsa State, was in disarray on Tuesday after youths went on the rampage, burning houses and destroying property in the area over a chieftaincy dispute.

Our correspondent gathered that many youths were killed in the incident as security operatives battled to restore order in the local government area Governor Seriake Dickson.

While some persons claimed that 12 youths died in the incident, the police said they had yet to ascertain the actual number of casualties.

The aggrieved youths were said to have attacked a police post in the community and injured police officers on duty.

While some sources said a policeman was killed in the melee, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Fidelis Odunna, denied the claims but said some officers were injured in the attack.

“The aggrieved youths attacked us but our men were able to repel the attack. But in the process, some of our men were injured. No police officer was killed,” he said.

It was learnt that the government had ordered security formations in the state, including the state police outfit codenamed Operation Doo-Akpo, to restore the peace in the community.

The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Kingsley Omire, was said to have led a special police team to the community.

The king was said to have escaped death by the whiskers.

It was gathered that trouble started following a report of a commission set up by the local government to determine the emergence of a paramount ruler in the community.

The report, according to sources, recommended that the acting paramount ruler should be made a permanent ruler.

The recommendation was said to have provoked crisis between youths supporting the report and those against it.

It was learnt that mutual suspicion had existed in the community since the former Governor of the state, Mr. Timiprey Sylva, sacked the erstwhile traditional ruler in the community, Chief Aziza Ekade, for alleged violation of existing chieftaincy laws.

Chief Victor Alali was said to have been acting as the traditional ruler in the community since the deposition of Ekade.

“We have since taken steps to bring the situation under control. Security operatives have responded swiftly and peace has been restored in the community,” he said.

Dickson, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Iworiso-Markson, condemned the action of the youths and asked them to embrace dialogue in resolving their matters."

Tension has gripped residents of Jos and Burkuru metropolis following the killing of two persons on Wednesday by gunmen.

The duo were killed at Sho village of Barakin Ladi Local Government Area, a few kilometres away from the scene where 10 persons were killed by gunmen on Monday.

The development, our correspondent gathered, had prompted the police in the state to order all drinking shops in the area not to operate beyond 6pm.

The police also barred similar shops in Jos and Buruku from operating their businesses beyond 7pm.

Eight persons were killed at a bar in Heipang, Barakin council area, while two others later died in a hospital.

Curiously, the two persons killed on Wednesday were relatives of the Chairman of Barakin Ladi Local Government council, Mr. Emmanuel Loman.

The incident occurred less than 24 hours after the council boss briefed newsmen on the siege to his domain by gunmen.

Loman, who confirmed the killing of his relatives to our correspondent, said some people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, besieged Sho in the early hours of Wednesday, attacking the inhabitants.

The gunmen were said to have laid ambush at strategic parts of the village and when they sighted the two men on a motorcycle, heading for farm, they shot and killed them.

Our correspondent gathered that as soon as news of the killings filtered through, youths from the Muslim dominated areas of Gangere, Dilimi, Angwan Rogo and Nasarawa Gwom, all in Jos North, anticipating a reprisal, mobilised for a counter-offensive.

Also, a protest by women in Barakin Ladi did not help matters as it worsened the mounting tension in the state.

However, fearing that the protest might be hijacked by hoodlums to cause mayhem in the state, and coupled with the restiveness occasioned by lingering strike by local government workers, security operatives quickly moved in to arrest the situation.

Police Public Relations Officer in the state, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, Emmnauel Abuh, who confirmed the killings, said a fresh security measure had become imperative in the state to check the new trend of attacks on drinking places.

He said, “We have also advised people to stop gathering in large numbers in a place to avoid a repeat of the Barakin Ladi incident.”"

The Eggon tribe had allegedly went hostile in the last two weeks involved in communal clash in both Agyaragu in the southern part of the state and Nasarawa Eggon in the northern part of the state.

But the police authorities in Nasarawa state had quickly exonerated its men from the alleged killing of the three Fulani men, saying that the uniformed men were not their officers.

Malam Hussaini Nuhu, secretary, Miyetti Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MCBAN), Nasarawa state chapter, has alleged that the men in police uniform were paid by a group to kill the Fulani.

Nuhu said that for the police to raid the Fulani settlement without provocation goes to show that they were paid to kill, while calling on the authorities to intervene and ensure that justice is done.

“If the authorities fail in their duty to ensure justice, then they leave the people with no option than to take laws into their hands.”

Nuhu said his association will follow the matter to its logical conclusion and ensure that justice is done to avoid a repetition of such unwanted killings by the security agencies.

Ardo Mohammed Dahiru , the community leader in the area, claimed that the police officers, who were drafted from the Uke Divisional Police Station in Karu local government area, stormed the Fulani settlement around 5 am and killed the 70-year-old man with his two sons.

Dahiru added that the uniform men shot sporadically, killing two people instantly, while the third person died on the way to the hospital.

He explained that the police were noticed by a crippled who hid in a bush and was able to identify their patrol van, which they kept at a distance as they killed the three men.

He alleged that the incident took place a day when the Eggon were planning a protest over the alleged destruction of their farmland by the herdsmen.

Dahiru appealed to the state government to look into the matter with a view to finding the killers and ensuring that justice is done.

The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Micheal Ada, who confirmed the death of the Fulani men, howeve, denied that they were killed by policemen drafted to restore peace in the area.

Unknown gunmen have reportedly burnt down the Madagali Divisional Police Station in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State.

An eyewitness, who preferred anonymity, told the News Agency of Nigeria in Yola on Thursday on phone that the gunmen set the station ablaze around 7p.m on Wednesday.

The source added that the attack claimed the life of the only inmate in detention at the station.

Confirming the incident, the Adamawa Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Mohammed Ibrahim, told NAN that the station was burnt down, but there was no police casualty.

“There was no police casualty and I am yet to confirm the death of anybody in detention,” Ibrahim said.

The town is on the state’s border with Borno State, while the attack is the second in the area within the year.

The attack followed a similar one visited on the Shuwa Police station located in the area early this year."

“When the gunmen arrived the school at about 2:00a.m, the security guard alerted soldiers and policemen at the military post at the bridge. On reaching the dormitory, the gunmen fled through the perimetre fence and went to a nearby village, where they exchange gunfire with the security agents, which lasted for about one and half hours.

Prof. Kamene Okonjo and Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala

he mother of the Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who was abducted from her home in Ogwashi-Ukwu in Delta State on Dec. 9, 2012, has been released.

Saturday PUNCH gathered that the kidnap victim, 82-year-old Prof. Kamene Okonjo, was dropped off near her home at about 10 am on Friday after spending five days in the kidnappers’ den.

A few hours after Okonjo reunited with her family at the palace of the Obi of Ogwashi-Ukwu, the police in Delta State shed light on the circumstances that led to her release.

The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ikechukwu Aduba, said there had been a bloody shootout between his men and the kidnappers in Asaba, the state capital, which had resulted in the rescue of the kidnap victim.

During the encounter, a suspected kidnap kingpin, Mr. Nwazor Nwose, aka Bolaji, believed to have masterminded the abduction, was shot dead by security agents.

In a meeting with journalists in Asaba, Aduba described Nwose as a notorious kidnapper who had been arraigned in court on a previous kidnap charge in Delta State and granted bail.

The CP said, “Nwose was arrested a few months ago, investigated and arraigned in court for kidnapping and was released on bail by the court. But he returned to Asaba and continued his nefarious activities.

“This time, he met his Waterloo. Combined detectives from the IGP taskforce and that of the State Police Command swung into action and invaded his hideout. Immediately he sighted the police he jumped a very high fence. Our men had no option; we had to obey the rule of engagement and opened fire on him.

“He continued, but eventually we got him by trailing the blood stain. We rushed him to Federal Medical Centre, Asaba where he gave up the ghost.

“Notwithstanding, four members of the gang were picked up. Two have been indicted so far. Another notorious criminal called Bright is in our custody. The names of the other gang members are Hard Rock, Tse-tse fly, and Tipper Boy.”

Saturday PUNCH learnt that Nwose had previously been involved in the abduction and murder of an oil magnate in Asaba in 2011.

Aduba said the operation to rescue the queen began on Dec. 13, stressing that it was concluded in the early hours of Dec. 14.

He said the police refrained from attacking the hideout of the kidnappers in Kwale, Ndokwa West LGA on account of the frail and advanced age of the victim.

Aduba said Prof. Okonjo was brought to the palace on a motorcycle early yesterday morning hale and hearty.

“We knew the victim was in Kwale, but we were very cautious not to invade the town so that she would not be harmed. We waited patiently and continued to monitor the area. Mama was brought in this morning by a motorcycle,” he said, adding that the two vehicles used in the abduction of Okonjo, a Toyota minibus with registration number KPP 64 XA and a grey Volkswagen Golf car registration number ASB 697 AA, had been impounded.

The residents of Ogwashi-Uku jubilated as the news of Okonjo’s release reached them on Friday.

Earlier, in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan said the government had refused to negotiate with the kidnappers.

In the report, which was published online, Uduaghan claimed that the kidnappers might have yielded to pressure to let Prof. Okonjo go.

Still, speculation was rife across the country that the N200m ransom demanded by the kidnappers might have been paid before the minister’s mother was released."

Security operatives in Enugu State apprehended and held hostage the correspondent of The PUNCH in the state, Ozioma Ubabukoh, on Saturday. In this interview Ubabukoh recalled his experience in the hands of the security operatives

Men claiming to be from the State Security Service waylaid you on Saturday, what actually happened?

I was on my way home, about a quarter past 11pm, when seven men accosted me. As I drove into the close – Corporation Boulevard – where I live in Trans-Ekulu area of Enugu State, they blocked my car, thereby preventing me from moving further. Before I could ask what the matter was they asked me to open the doors of my car or they would get violent. I obeyed and two of them jumped into the car while the rest walked away.

They told me not to be scared and that they wanted to ensure I would not write any story that night (Saturday) concerning the rumour of Governor Sullivan Chime’s death. They ordered me to drive into the compound and warned that I shouldn’t scream or they would get tough with me. They subsequently seized my BlackBerry and gave me the sim card.

They took me to my apartment where they ransacked my room and took away my laptop.

They told me they would wait at the staircase and leave at 3am, but would return my BB and laptop before doing so. They turned down my request to get water downstairs. They were still at the staircase when I contacted newsroom in Lagos, using my MTN sim card on an old Nokia phone. I was also able to reach out to some colleagues through my Visafone line.

What amazed me, however, was that the men knew I was reaching out to people. However, they warned me not to “try anything funny,” or they would deal “ruthlessly” with me. Shortly before 12.30am, they came in to tell me they were leaving but would return at 3am with my “property.” I was in suspense because I knew there was no way they would return since the contact door downstairs would be locked as well as the main gate.

Did they eventually return your BlackBerry and laptop?

They did. When I waited till 4am and there was no electricity supply, I went downstairs and switched on the generator. Not long after, I started charging my phones, someone called me with a hidden number to tell me that my BB and laptop were under my car. I hurried downstairs and indeed, found the phone and laptop under the car. The things were very dusty and the battery of the laptop had run down – they had obviously searched my documents.

You said one of them called you. Did you give them your phone number?

I didn’t give any of them my phone number. They never asked for it. How they got my phone number was yet another mystery.

Was there any proof from them to show that they were indeed from the SSS?

There was no proof. Before they came upstairs, I had inquired to know who they were. The taller of the two said they were from the State Security Service. I then asked for their identity cards, but he became angry, saying, “All the stories that you have been writing about the governor in Enugu, have you ever asked for peoples’ ID cards? You don’t ask for ID cards when you are doing your job, so allow me to do my job.”

When you first encountered them at the entrance of your close, why didn’t you attempt to reverse?

I almost did, but I couldn’t because the entrance to the close is very sloppy. Attempting to reverse would have caused an accident, or worsened the situation.

Would you recognise any of them?

Their command of the English language was impeccable. They wore mostly long sleeve T-shirts, jeans trousers, dark goggles, snickers to match and looked very neat. However, I have not come across any of them in the past. Well, I think I can recognise the huge, tall one who led the operation to my room. He is also a dark-skinned man.

Why do you think you were the only journalist that was harassed in Enugu State that fateful day?

The state government had earlier accused me of being vocal over Governor Sullivan Chime’s health status. The government in the past sponsored advertorials (October 18) on two national dailies against me, this was shortly after I broke the story on the governor’s health and his continuous absence from the state on October 14.

Was any other journalist harassed after Saturday’s incident?

No. No other journalist has been harassed since then."

John Ene-Obong and two members of the church, have been allegedly killed over a land dispute.

Rev. Ene-Obong, who was allegedly killed penultimate Monday by irate youths over a land dispute in Ikot Ene-Obong community of the metropolis, was said to have returned to Nigeria from Canada barely a week before his death.

The pastor was allegedly killed alongside two others, whose names were given as Effiong Koko-Ette and Victor Ene-Boco.

Investigations revealed that the disputed land belongs to the family of the slain pastor and the death was a reprisal attack over an earlier killing of one Eton, who was killed in the same farm land over allegation that he was responsible for the maiming of another man identified as Effiong.

Effiong, it was gathered, was a victim of the protracted land dispute and now lives with just one leg after several gun shots, which led to one of his legs being amputated.

A family source, who did not want his name in print, said the pastor went on an inspection visit in company of the two other victims, when the incident occurred.

State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. John Umoh, said investigations were ongoing, adding that six persons had been arrested in connection with the killings, while the principal suspect was at large.

He said, ""The state Criminal Investigation Department had taken over the matter. Six persons have so far been arrested in connection with that killing. There is one principal suspect that is still at large. However, those arrested are still in our custody and we would not release them until investigations had been concluded."""

Four foreign sailors kidnapped in Bayelsa. Gunman kills three persons, injures five in Bauchi

Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi with agency reportsâ€¨

A shootout in North-eastern Nigeria between security forces and members of Boko Haram sect has left about 15 people dead including a local police chief, the Associated Press (AP) has said.

This came as gunmen attacked a supply tug boat in the Niger Delta, kidnapping four foreign sailors in the latest attack that is increasingly becoming dangerous for shippers and oil companies.

Also, an unknown gunman yesterday killed three persons and injured five others in Bigi village, a suburb in Bauchi in what was described as an unprovoked attack.

However, it was gathered that the shootings took place in the city of Potiskum, which has increasingly become the scene of violent attacks by the sect.

Army spokesman, Lt. Eli Lazarus, said the attack began late Sunday night in the city and went on for hours after suspected sect members bombed a local police station and attacked a bank branch.

Lazarus said the dead included a police chief and 14 suspected Boko Haram members. Civilians have been killed in such shoot-outs before and Nigeria’s military routinely downplays such casualties.

The identity of those who died could not be independently verified, though Lazarus said those killed had been carrying weapons and ammunition.

Lazarus said authorities only collected four corpses of the suspected sect fighters, as the other 10 “were dragged away by other Boko Haram members in order to hide their identity.”

It was unclear the motivation behind the attack, though analysts and local security officials believe Boko Haram has funded some of its attacks through bank robberies in which sect members blow open bank buildings to steal the money inside.

The kidnap of the four foreign sailors, according to Associated Press, happened 40 nautical miles off the coast of Bayelsa State in the Niger Delta on Sunday night, as the gunmen stormed the moving vessel, the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said yesterday in a warning to other shippers.

The gunmen seized four workers and later fled, the bureau said.

It added that those remaining onboard safely guided the ship to a nearby harbor, the bureau said.

The bureau did not identify the shipper, nor the sailors.

However, a separate notice to private security contractors working in Nigeria and seen by AP identified the four hostages as foreigners.

In Rome, the Foreign Ministry confirmed the kidnapping, saying the four hostages were members of the crew.

A foreign Ministry official said three of the four were Italian.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release the information publicly, said he didn’t know the nationality of the fourth hostage.

Foreign Minister, Giulio Terzi, was following the case personally, and the ministry was working with Nigerian officials to secure the safe return of the crew, the official said.

The official and the private security notice seen by the AP identified the vessel attacked as the Asso Ventuno, operated by Augusta Offshore SpA, a Naples-based shipping company.

The company’s website says itdoes business with oil companies Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp. in Nigeria.

A spokesman for Nigeria Navy, Commodore Kabir Aliyu, declined to comment on the issue.

Pirate attacks are on the rise in West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea, which follows the continent’s southward curve from Liberia to Gabon.

Over the last year and a half, piracy therehas escalated from low-level armed robberies to hijackings and cargo thefts.

Last year, London-based Lloyd’s Market Association - an umbrella group of insurers - listed Nigeria, neighbouring Benin and nearby waters in the same risk category as Somalia, where two decades of war and anarchy have allowed piracy to flourish.

Analysts believe many of the attackers come from Nigeria, whose lawless waters and often violent oil regionroutinely see foreigners kidnapped for ransom. Increasingly, criminal gangs also have targeted middle and upper-class Nigerians as well.

Sunday’s kidnapping is just the latest attack in the region.

On December 17, gunmen kidnapped five Indian sailors on the SPBrussels tanker as it sat about 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the coast of the Niger Delta.

That came the same day gunmen abducted four South Koreans and a Nigerian working for Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. at a construction site in the Brass area of Bayelsa State.

Those workers were later released, though the Indians are still believed to be held by the abductors.

The gunman was said to have to have shot and killed the people at a local food joint.

A reliable security source told THISDAY that “the gunman entered a joint where people were eating and drink, he sat there and ate something and after, he shot three people. Some good Samaritans in the joint attempted to overpower him and arrested him. He used his gun to hit two people that also sustained injuries before he fled.”

The source further disclosed that “all the five injured people have been taken to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital for medical treatment.

The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abbas Abdullahi, who confirmed the incident, said, “Yes it had happened but all the people shot did not die they are in the hospital I don’t know the number but I saw the signal.”

Security operatives have beefed up security in the area to prevent further attack or break down of law and order."

FROM GEORGE ONYEJIUWA, Owerri

Senator Chris Anyanwu, who represents Imo East (Owerri) in the National Assembly, yesterday described as a misplaced show of state power by Governor Rochas Okorocha whose convoy did not only push her car off the road but that the governor allegedly ordered her security to be disarmed and watched from his car while her drivers were dragged out of the cars and brutally assaulted.

But the state government in a statement signed by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, Mr. Ebere Uzoukwa, said that the Senator allegedly committed serious security breach against the governor which requires further investigations.

“The Senator’s vehicle suddenly rammed into the governor’s convoy close to the staff car, cutting off the pilot security vehicle after allegedly overtaking dangerously and in a very suspicious manner,” Uzoukwa said.

However, Senator Anyanwu, who spoke with journalists at her Owerri residence yesterday, described the actions of the governor’s securitymen as frightening and brutish, alleging that she had been harassed, intimidated and threatened in the past at several occasions in the state.

Explaining the clash between her convoy and the governor’s securitymen, Senator Anyanwu said that, “my day started around 9.30am when I visited the governor at the Government House on Tuesday to exchange pleasantries. He asked if I had adequate security and I said yes after which I left for my hometown, Mbaise.

“When we got to Azara Egbelu along Owerri/Umuahia Road, we heard a siren coming behind us and when it grew louder, we parked to allow the convoy to pass, but surprisingly, the approaching convoy which comprised of truck loads of armed and stern-looking men double-crossed us and pulled out two of my drivers and dragged them into the bush where they were mercilessly beaten and left one of the drivers, Odilichukwu, with broken skull and bruises.

“When I could not bear it any more, I rushed out of my car with bare feet and started shouting: I am Senator Chris Anyanwu, please, don’t kill my driver, but one of the armed men charged at me and threatened to shoot me for running into the governor’s convoy. All these while, the governor was sitting in his car with the glass rolled down and I heard him shout at his securitymen to disarm my orderlies”, the Senator said.

Anyanwu, who is also the Chairman, Senate Committee on Navy, described the governor’s action as “a misplaced show of power. The power of the state is so enormous and you don’t need to intimidate, harass or kill your people to assert your powers as a governor. I am tired of all these abuses and harassment in this state. It is not only in Imo State that they have female legislators. If they could do this to me, what would happen to the ordinary people? This has to stop,”Anyanwu said.

However, the state government described Senator Anyanwu’s conduct as a security breach, unbecoming of someone of her position, adding that her outburst of anger could have resulted to heavy casualty if not for the discipline of the governor’s securitymen, who displayed high sense of decency, professionalism and maturity.

“Surprisingly, Senator Anyanwu who no doubt knew the convoy was that of the Governor of Imo State alighted from her car and allegedly ordered her naval security personnel to open fire. The senator further went berserk by slapping both the governor’s aide-de- camp and Chief Security Detail. She also allegedly rained abuses on the governor”, Uzoukwa said."

Gunmen

No fewer than 30 persons were feared dead in Maiha, Adamawa State, when gunmen stormed the town in the early hours of Friday, the eagleonline.com.ng reports.

The gunmen, who were reported to have arrived in Maiha at about 3 am, wrecked havoc at the prison, divisional police station, Government Lodge and a court in the town.

The attackers were said to have bombarded the prison and set free an undisclosed number of inmates.

They also set ablaze two court rooms and the Government Lodge, sources said.

The state Controller of Prisons, Andrew Barka, confirmed the attack on the prison by the gunmen.

Barka, however, did not give details.

He said he was on his way to the town with the state Commissioner of Police, Godfrey Okeke.

Okeke would also not give details of the incident.

He said he was on his way to the town to assess the situation.

Meanwhile, some residents said that about 40 gunmen in cars and on foot carried out the attacks on the border posts with neighbouring Cameroon, opening fire on police and chanting Allahu Akbar (God is Great).

“The gunmen believed to be Boko Haram members, were around 40 in number and came in Hilux vans and on motorcycles at about 1 am and attacked the police station and other security offices, including the area court, burning them,” said Garbajo Abubakar, a resident of the area.

“They opened fire on the security personnel but it is hard to say how many people were hurt or killed,” Abubakar added.

Corroborating the story, another resident, John Yohanna, said the gunmen went into town “chanting ‘Allahu Akbar,’” and burnt down the divisional police station and other government establishments."

Inset: Oyinloye and bullet holes on the gate. Photos: Eniola Akinkuotu

At least six policemen were killed in separate robbery incidents in different parts of Lagos over the weekend, PUNCH Metro has learnt.

The policemen, it was learnt, were killed during robbery operations.

Also, a mother of four, Lateefah Oyinloye, was killed during one of such incidents.

It was learnt that the robberies occurred in Ajah, Aguda and Oyingbo areas of the state between Saturday and Sunday.

Our correspondent, who visited Oyingbo on Monday, learnt that a robbery occurred on Redemption Way.

It was learnt that a police corporal, identified only as Moroof, was killed alongside Oyinloye.

A resident of Redemption Way, Alhaja Olorun Orerun, told PUNCH Metro that the robbers, numbering about eight, stormed her home around 1:30am on Saturday and robbed her family.

She said, “Around 1:30am, some armed robbers jumped over my fence and entered the house. They robbed us all and riddled the entire house with bullets.

“Two of the robbers stood guard outside the compound while six stayed inside and ransacked the house. One of the robbers wore a mask while the others didn’t.

“They locked me and my husband inside the toilet and opened fire on the door. Luckily, no one in my house was killed.”

A resident, who craved anonymity, said while the robbers were trying to escape, they sighted a policeman in a patrol vehicle and opened fire on him.

He said Oyinloye, who was in a taxi at the time, was hit by a bullet.

He said, “Policemen from Denton Station usually come to our street to raid a joint in the area. A team of policemen had gone on the usual raid but the police corporal (Moroof) remained in the vehicle.

“Unluckily for him, the robbers saw him and immediately opened fire. Oyinloye was in a taxi at the time and was on her way home when she was hit by a bullet.”

Our correspondent observed bullet holes on parked vehicles on the street as well as the gate of Orerun’s house.

Oyinloye’s daughter, Bashirat, who wept as she spoke, said her mother sold drinks and usually closed late.

She said, “My mum sells spirits at Obalende and usually closes late at night. She usually comes home in a taxi. She was killed in the taxi.

“The matter has been reported to Denton Police Station but her corpse has not been released to us. We need to bury her quickly because we are Muslims.”

A family member, who craved anonymity, however lamented that the policemen demanded N34,000 before the corpse would be released.

“The policemen asked for N34,000 for embalmment and other expenses but we are negotiating with them to collect N20,000,” she said.

When contacted, telephone of the spokesperson for the state police command, Ngozi Braide, did not go through.

A Divisional Police Officer, who craved anonymity, however confirmed the death of five policemen.

He said, “Four policemen were killed at Ajah while one was killed at Oyingbo. I am not aware of that of Aguda.

“We had a meeting with the Commissioner of Police today (Monday) and security will be beefed up.”

The senior officer said the policemen killed in Ajah were ambushed in a patrol van by the robbers.

He said, “The area commander received a distress call and ordered his men to the scene. On their way there, the robbers came out from the bush and opened fire on them.

The four of them in the vehicle were killed. Co-incidentally, a traffic policeman and a civilian were within the area at that time. They were also killed.”"

Separately, residents and a Reuters witness said they heard a loud explosion and around 30 minutes of gunfire in the town, close to borders with Niger and Chad.

Boko Haram killed hundreds on people last year in an attempt to carve out an Islamic state in a country of 160 million split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims.

The group is the biggest security threat to Africa's leading oil producer and its insurgency has fed a general rise in criminality in Nigeria's mostly Muslim north.

Two witnesses, who asked not to be named, said they heard cries for help at around 2:30 a.m. from a house in the Jiddari Polo area of Maiduguri and later saw five dead bodies with what looked like machete wounds.

""Five people were slaughtered today but we can't say who did it because they fled before security personnel arrived,"" police spokesman Gabriel Jibrin said by phone.

Military and police said it was too early to give any details on any casualties from the explosion and gun battle.

Gunmen suspected of being members of Boko Haram killed 13 local hunters who sell bush meat Islamist militants disapprove of in Maiduguri on Monday.

Nigeria plans to deploy around 1,200 troops as part of a West African intervention force to combat Islamist militants occupying the north of Mali, and officials fear Nigeria's involvement could further inflame its own insurgency.

President Goodluck Jonathan said on Tuesday that tackling global jihadists was in Nigeria's interest because of the links between its Islamists and those in the desert states to the north, such as Mali.

An Islamist group known as Ansaru, which has been blamed for abducting and killing Westerners, claimed responsibility for an attack on Nigerian troops heading to Mali on Sunday that killed two officers.

Gunmen fired on the convoy of one of Nigeria's most senior Islamic leaders in Kano on Saturday, killing at least four people."

By SaharaReporters, New York

SaharaReporters has just received information from students living in Birnin Gwari town in Kaduna State to the effect that heavily armed bandits took over the Police Station in the area and burnt it down after about two hours of gun battle with troops.

The police station is completely razed in an attack that started at midnight, according to the source.

Banks and other public buildings were reportedly bombed along with the Police Station.

The source who claimed to have witnessed the attack said the bandits also planted Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) that exploded simultaneously in addition to sporadic gun shots.

The source also said that the whole area was sealed by the unidentified gunmen whose number could not be ascertained because of they came in the dark. Several police officers and some of the bandits are believed to have died in the attack which lasted about two hours.

“We are trapped, and under fear, we need military support to, if not there is no certainty on our lives. As I speak, they are still firing”, he said.

In October, 2012, bandits invaded the town killing some 20 worshippers leaving a Mosque in an early morning raid in the area.

Calls made to spokespersons of the army and police were not returned as at the time of this report.

Last year SaharaReporters Did a reasoned exposee on the problem of armed banditry in Birnin Gwari LGA: Seee report below:

Dogon Dawa Killings: Terrorists Believed To Be Bunkering In Kaduna Forests; Military Considering Armed Response

A SaharaReporters investigation in Dogon Dawa community, where over 20 people were killed in a mosque, and in other neighboring villages in Birnin Gwari local government area of Kaduna State, indicates that the suspected terrorists may be camping out under the cover of dense forests in Kaduna State.

Senior State Security Service personnel who had previously studied the area and made several for immediate action, confirmed to our reporters SaharaReporters the suspects are taking advantage of the forest, which borders Plateau, Niger, Kano, Zamfara and Katsina States, to hide.

A senior police officer also told our reporter that the immediate solution is military action, in which helicopters would be used to support ground troops. Barring this, he said ""they will continue to carry out their attacks and what we witnessed last Sunday [may be] just a joke.”

A SaharaReporters team which drove through villages in Niger State to Birnin Gwari spoke with villagers before arriving at the national park in a serene area called Kamuku.

The suspected terrorists, according to the locals, are heavily armed and live mainly in the thick forest except when they are traveling outside of the terrain.

They added that the suspected terrorists have established tents and other mobile settlements inside the forest, pointing out that some of them are foreigners while others are simply mercenaries who specialize in carrying out killings and counter attacks in Kaduna State and other parts of the North.

The locals told our reporters that the criminal elements also double as armed robbers to obtain money for their running costs and upkeep.

One of the villagers, speaking through an interpreter, said, “There are strange men inside the forests, they are camping in there and at times you will see them carrying their luggage on motorbikes before melting into the forests. There is nothing we can do, but they have never attacked us, but they have been targeting villages that formed vigilantes against their operations in the area. They do not talk with anyone. And we heard that they usually block the road and rob motorists.”

A security official who spoke on condition of anonymity further explained, “The whole area is under threat, these people come here from hundreds of kilometres away, through the bush, from forests in Zamfara or Katsina. They get here well-armed and know the terrain. We need ground troops and air support to raid and survey the whole forests. It is an urgent exercise.”

There were differing views in Dogon Dawa community where over 20 people were butchered on Sunday. Muhammad, who is a relative of the late vigilante leader, Ahmadu Aliyu, said that the armed robbers came to kill their father because he was a thorn in their flesh.

""These people are organized terrorists or militia; we know armed robbers cannot carry out this act in this manner. They came around 4:30 am and left around 6:30 am.”

Another young boy who spoke in tears said, “They are thieves tormenting us and all the travelers in the Birnin Gwari routes. But it is obvious they engaged services of experienced killers and they wrote us that they will come, but the authorities did not care until they struck.”

SaharaReporters saw armed soldiers and anti-riot policemen fully stationed around the area, but none of them agreed to talk to our reporter."

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, - Boko Haram insurgents killed at least six park rangers on Tuesday in a reprisal attack after troops backed by helicopter gunships destroyed their base in a Nigerian game reserve.

Security forces last week killed 17 militants and destroyed two Boko Haram training camps in the northeast, one in a forest and one in the Sambisa Reserve.

""Six people were killed. Many of our staff are still missing as the camp is now deserted,"" he said.

Neither the military nor Boko Haram were available for comment.

Boko Haram are seen as the most serious threat to the stability of Nigeria, Africa's top energy producer, and Western governments fear it could become a base for operations of al Qaeda-linked Islamist groups in the Sahara.

Violence has persisted since a Boko Haram commander declared a ceasefire last week, raising doubts about his credibility.

President Goodluck Jonathan has highlighted links between Boko Haram and Saharan Islamists, including al Qaeda's North African affiliate, as a reason for joining efforts by French and West African forces to fight them in Mali.

In Kaduna State, armed robbers, numbering over 50 attacked Birnin Gwari town killing three policemen, a villager even as they used rocket launchers and grenades to destroy a divisional police station and two commercial banks in the area.

The robbers carried out the attack hours after Emir of Birnin Gwari Alhaji Zubair Jibril complained to Kaduna Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero that armed bandits had taken over his domain.

The robbers, who started operation at the middle of the town around 12 midnight detonated over 20 grenades and rocket launchers before leaving.

It was gathered that the bandits used the explosives to gain entry into the branches of First Bank and Ecobank and to destroy the police station.

Locals told Daily Trust that the bandits who spent over four hours carrying out the operation went to the town around 11.pm in three buses and many motorcycles.

""We did not know where they first attacked but we started hearing sound of guns and bombs around 12 midnight and it lasted for over four hours. They killed policemen, released all suspects in detention and we learnt that they went away with guns,"" a trader in the town said.

In Kaduna State, armed robbers, numbering over 50 attacked Birnin Gwari town killing three policemen, a villager even as they used rocket launchers and grenades to destroy a divisional police station and two commercial banks in the area.

The robbers carried out the attack hours after Emir of Birnin Gwari Alhaji Zubair Jibril complained to Kaduna Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero that armed bandits had taken over his domain.

The robbers, who started operation at the middle of the town around 12 midnight detonated over 20 grenades and rocket launchers before leaving.

It was gathered that the bandits used the explosives to gain entry into the branches of First Bank and Ecobank and to destroy the police station.

Locals told Daily Trust that the bandits who spent over four hours carrying out the operation went to the town around 11.pm in three buses and many motorcycles.

""We did not know where they first attacked but we started hearing sound of guns and bombs around 12 midnight and it lasted for over four hours. They killed policemen, released all suspects in detention and we learnt that they went away with guns,"" a trader in the town said.

Speaking when Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero visited Emir of Birnin Gwari yesterday over the attack, the Emir said the armed robbers drank tea at a tea joint and refilled their cars at a filling station before starting their operation.

""We could not sleep throughout the night because of the attack. It was as if we were in war front, they detonated over 20 bombs. We quickly performed ablution and started praying throughout the operation. They operated like trained soldiers in war front. They were sophisticated armed robbers.

""Please we are begging in the name of Allah, help us to tell the Federal Government to establish police area command and military formation here because it takes hours to draft security men from Kaduna to this place. These armed robbers can decide to block the road one day in order to attack us "", he said.

Governor Yero said he would partner with other state governors to address the situation and urged people of the community to always give security agencies in the area information about the bandits.

Kaduna police commissioner Olufemi Adenaike confirmed the number of casualties, saying his men engaged the bandits but that they overpowered them when they detonated grenades and rocket launchers.

And in Kano State, a police sergeant and a civilian were shot dead when unknown gunmen stormed Bunkure divisional police station shooting and throwing explosives at the police station.

The robbery, which occurred at about 11pm, was allegedly successful because the robbers used another white man to gain entrance to the victim’s building.

It was learnt that the robbers were able to deceive the victim’s security guards because of the presence of the white man who was with the robbers.

Police sources told PUNCH Metro that some of the robbers, on gaining entrance, shot sporadically into the air, while other members of the gang stormed the victim’s rooms, ransacking everywhere.

They were said to have made away with some of his valuables. The victim was not hurt.

The victim’s residence is close to Command Guest House, which belonged to the Nigerian Army.

When soldiers on guard at the Command Guest House heard the shootings, one of them opened the gate and the robbers, on sighting him, opened fire.

The soldier died on the spot. Another of his colleagues was also killed, while a third soldier’s leg was shattered by bullets.

It was learnt that some mobile policemen attached to a popular hotel in the area, who were attracted by gunshot sounds, engaged the robbers in a protracted gun battle.

The robbers later fled in the victim’s jeep.

They, however, abandoned their own metallic grey Honda car, marked GJ435 LSR.

It was learnt that the soldier, whose leg was shattered, was rushed to an undisclosed hospital.

Deputy Police Public Relations Officer of the state, Mr. Damascus Ozoani, said although the police got wind of the robbery, it could not comment on it.

He said, “There was no official report at any police station. Since the incident affected the army, I suggest that you call the army PRO.”

The army spokesman, Captain Eze, said he had not been briefed on the incident. He promised to make enquiry and get back to PUNCH Metro.

The spokesman, 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, Lt. Col. Kayode Ogunsanya, did not pick his calls. The text message sent to his number was also not replied to."

Peter Obi and police commissioner

Two days ago, a joint sitting of two Senate committees meeting in Awka, the Anambra State capital, heard that ten detainees in police custody may have been killed and dumped into the Ezu River at Amansea. Nigerians were horrified when members of the Amansea community raised alarms after finding numerous corpses floating on the Ezu River on January 19, 2013. So far, there has been no official word on the identity of the corpses.

However, witnesses who appeared before the joint committees suggested that the corpses were likely those of detainees killed by officers of the Nigerian Police which is notorious for extra-judicial executions. The senators were told that the police had denied the families of the ten missing persons access to them from October 22, 2012 till now.

The Senate committee on Police Affairs, led by Igwe Paulinus Nwagu, and the committee on Security and Intelligence, led by Mohammed Magoro, held their public hearing Tuesday at the multipurpose hall in Government House, Awka. Among the witnesses was Uwaneke Udegbunam, a lawyer, who narrated the harrowing account of one Chiekezie Obiofor, his client and relative, from Omor town in Ayamelum local government area. Mr. Udegbunam stated that officers of the Anambra Police Command arrested his client on October 22, 2012. According to him, his client and two other men, PraiseGod Ndumanya and Chinwuba Okoye, were taken into custody at the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Awkuzu, Oyi local government area.

The lawyer disclosed that the police in Awkuzu initially denied having Mr Obiofor in their custody, but he was assured by a high-level contact that his client was indeed taken to SARS, Awkuzu. Unable to bail his client, he filed a court case November 12, 2012. In court, the police asserted that his client had died, but failed to release his remains.

The lawyer pleaded with the Senate committee to call for all the files submitted by the police to the Anambra State Ministry of Justice which are labeled “Sudden and Untimely Death” (SUD). The files, he said, would help the committee reach the truth about what happened in Amansea and about a culture of extra-judicial killings in Anambra State. Mr. Udegbunam said he stumbled on a case where a dead person supposedly deposited his own body in the morgue, stating that the receipt for morgue payment was issued in the deceased’s name. The lawyer implored the senators to order the police to release the body of his client to assure the man’s family that he was not among those thrown into the Ezu River.

Also testifying before the panel, an official of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) insisted that nine of their members were arrested on November 9, 2012 and had not been allowed access to their families or MASSOB officials.

Uche Madu, MASSOB’s director of information, asserted that they had received information that the police killed their members and dumped them in the river. He told the committee that MASSOB received reports of the extra-judicial killings one week before the bodies were discovered in the river. He added that the denial by the Anambra State Commissioner of Police was untrue.

Asked why it took his organization three weeks to react, Mr. Madu said that they decided to conduct a thorough investigation first, adding that “as long as the bodies are still kept in the morgue, we can still go and identify them.”

Senator Nwagu ruled that MASSOB’s testimony should be documented and asked the movement’s officials to further testify before the Senate committee in Abuja along with the relatives of the deceased.

Testifying earlier, the Anambra State Police Commissioner, the state Commissioner for Health, and the transition chairman for Awka North local government area denied ordering the burial of the floating corpses. The police commissioner, Mr. Nasarawa, told the committee that, after his officers’ arrival at the scene, Governor Peter Obi had directed him to bury the bodies. However, he testified that he told the governor that it was not the duty of the police to bury corpses. The governor then called on the chairman caretaker committee of Awka North local government, who reportedly said it was not the responsibility of her council. The police commissioner then said Mr. Obi ordered both the police and the Awka North council to see that the bodies were buried.

The police commissioner’s testimony at the public hearing sharply contrasted with his earlier claim at the bridge that members of the local community in Amansea had buried the corpses without the knowledge of the police.

When asked at the bridge by Senator Nwagu if blood stains were found on top of the bridge, Mr. Nasarawa simply said, “We have not found any.” His claim surprised reporters who had reported the presence of blood stains when the story broke.

The Enugu State Police Commissioner, Musa Daura, answered in the negative when asked if other communities along the course of Ezu River had been questioned about the corpses.

Horrified members of the Amansea community discovered close to 50 bodies on January 19, 2012. The raised an alarm which prompted the visit of the Anambra State Police Commissioner and, later, the state Commissioner for Local Governments who told the media that Governor Obi was abroad but had been briefed about the dreadful discoveries.

Mr. Obi later visited the scene on January 21 and offered N5 million for anyone with useful information to solve the mystery of the dead bodies. The police confirmed recovery of 18 bodies, out of which three were reportedly taken for autopsy while 15 were said to be buried at the bank of the river, without identification.

However, when Senator Chris Ngige visited the scene on January 24, reporters spotted two bodies and blood stains were seen on the bridge. Residents of Amansea also reported that two other bodies were discovered two days earlier, on January 22.

On January 28, 2012, pathologists from the Nigeria Police and the Anambra State Government visited the bank of Ezu River in response to public outcry and to media reports about “shocking discoveries” on the three bodies earlier subjected to autopsy. The police and state officials promised to exhume the buried bodies for autopsies as well. In addition, they took away new bodies from the site to an unknown destination.

Many observers were taken aback when the police claimed on Monday that the total number of bodies was 19. That claim was echoed by the Secretary to the state government, Oseloka Obaze, during the Senate’s fact-finding mission on Tuesday.

The Senate hearing has moved to Enugu."

This came after Saturday’s attack by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen at the Aduwan Gida Village in Zango-Kataf Local Government Area, also in the southern part of the state, killing five persons, including a six-year-old boy and his mother.

Our correspondent gathered that an object, suspected to be bomb, had exploded at a refuse dump in the area, forcing residents to flee the area.

The incident took place just as the state Governor, Ramallan Yero, was on a visit to the area (southern part of the state), where some Fulani herdsmen had attacked residents of Aduwan village on Saturday.

During the visit, the governor vowed to fish out the perpetrators of the attack, stressing that he would make them to face the full wrath of the law.

An impeccable source, who preferred anonymity, told our correspondent that the bomb blast was a hoax.

The source said, “It was not a bomb blast as people were made to believe.”

The source said the incident, which took place at about 11am, instilled fears in residents of the area.

The source recalled, “We just heard a sound, which forced people to run helter-skelter. Some people actually ran to the place the incident took place, but nobody was injured.”

It was also learnt that men of the Anti-bomb Squad of Kaduna StatePolice Command were dispatched to the area, who later discovered that there was no bomb blast.

Also, the Vice Chairman of the local government, Mr. Alfred Maisamari, confirmed to journalists on the telephone that there was no bomb explosion as being rumoured. He said it was an empty shell of mosquito insecticide that exploded.

“There is no cause for alarm. What happened today was not a bomb explosion. It was an empty mosquito insecticide shell that exploded. It happened outside the town and not even a soul or building was affected,” he said.

The Police Public Relations Office in the state, Aminu Lawan, a Deputy Superintendent of Police,, while confirming the incident, also said, “It was not an explosion. Some people were just clearing and burning the environment when the sound was heard. There are no houses near the place, and so, nobody or any property got affected.”

Besides, hundreds of houses and business premises, including places of worship were razed down by the warring groups who engaged in a gun duel, thereby rendering thousands of people homeless and striped of their means of livehood.

The crisis, which erupted in the early hours of Saturday, THISDAY gathered, was ignited by an argument between some youths during an early morning football training session at a football pitch located in the town which later snowballed into a bloody clash following the killing of one of the youths in the course of the argument.

In the ensuing mayhem, dangerous weapons were freely used by the youths who later engaged each other in gun battle while residents were forced to flee their homes to take refuge in nearby bushes just as some had to flee to neighbouring communities.

""The crisis started as an argument between two youths at the football field and in the course of the argument, one of the youths was shot. In an attempt to retaliate the killing of the young man who is an adherent of one of the religions, it became a full blown war between Christians and Muslims who engaged themselves with dangerous weapons including guns,"" an eyewitness who spoke to THISDAY on condition of anonymity said.

A victim of the crisis, Agyo Ado, whose family house was razed in the mayhem, told THISDAY in a telephone interview that no fewer than 40 persons were killed at different locations in the town though one of the members representing Wukari in the State House of Assembly, Hon. Daniel Ishaya Gani, told newsmen that five lives were lost to the crisis while properties worth billions of naira was destroyed by the warring groups.

He however disclosed that some of the injured victims, who were being treated at the General Hospital, Wukari and other health facilities in the town, were in critical conditions, saying medical personnel were trying their best to prevent more casualties.

""It is unfortunate that while the country and state governments are working round the clock to ensure peace, some few individuals are still taking laws into their hands but I am pleading with the warring groups to sheath their swords and embrace peace,"" Gani, who is also the deputy majority leader and chairman, House Committee on Information, said.

Speaking on behalf of the State Police Commissioner, Ibrahim Maishanu, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Amos Olaoye, said several teams of heavily armed policemen and anti riot squad have been dispatched from different locations to the town to restore peace and normalcy. He said the police would conduct a thorough investigation into the remote and immediate cause of the crisis.

Meanwhile, a community leader in the town, Chief Mannaseh, has told THISDAY that thousands of residents of the town have fled to neighbouring Benue and Plateau States as well as nearby Local Government Areas, particularly Ibi, Donga, Takum and Gassol.

Efforts to speak with the chairman of the Local Government, Hon. Dan Azumi Agbu, proved abortive as his GMS line was unavailable though THISDAY gathered that he made spirited efforts to bring the situation under control , particularly by mobilising security agencies to the troubled town.

It would be recalled that a similar crisis between Christians and Muslims broke out in November last year at Ibi, less than 20 kilometres drive from Wukari in which over 30 lives were reportedly lost and properties worth billions of naira destroyed.

The state acting governor, Alhaji Garuba Umar, who took over the reins of power in the state a few days earlier following the crash of the governor declared a dusk to dawn curfew in the town which he later reviewed to 24 hours following the escalation of the crisis. The curfew in the town is still in force though it has been relaxed drastically due to return of normalcy to the town."

By SaharaReporters, New York

SaharaReporters has learnt that two persons lost their lives during the week as gunmen invaded the oil-rich Uzere community in the Isoko South local government area of Delta state. Several members of the community told SaharaReporters that they suspect the gunmen, who reportedly arrived from neighboring Irri, were hired for the killing mission by Isaac Udogri, the exiled traditional ruler of Uzere, as well as Askia Ogieh, a former boss of the Isoko South council. The community sources also accused Solomon Ewenede, a former secretary of the Local Education Authority (LEA), of complicity in sponsoring the tragic invasion.

At one point, Nigeria’s security officials killed three youngsters in the community. A source told SaharaReporters that the killings were unconnected to the memorandum of understanding that Shell officials refused to sign with the community in 2011.

The gunmen reportedly invaded Uzere at about 6:50 a.m. brandishing pump action guns. “They shot sporadically into the air for about 20 minutes before they retreated to Solomon Ewenede’s house in the kingdom,” a source told SaharaReporters.

The source added that a group of youngsters in the community went to Mr. Ewenede’s house on learning that the gunmen were there. “As they approached Ewenede’s house, the gunmen opened fire, killing one Omojoli ldolor, a security guard to the newly installed traditional ruler, Henry Etuwede 111.”

Our source disclosed that the Uzere youths regrouped for a reprisal attack on Mr. Ewenede’s house. “They killed one of the gunmen and severely wounded another one,” the source disclosed. In addition, the irate youths reportedly razed Mr. Ewenede’s house. SaharaReporters learnt that a team of stern-looking soldiers, anti-riot mobile police officers and naval officers had established a presence in the community.

Several members of the community accused the police as well as the state government of cooperating with the deposed ruler and Mr. Askia in order to cause mayhem in Uzere. One source said police officers last Wednesday came to the town and arrested some people perceived to be opposed to the deposed king. Some community members believe the police officers came at the behest of the dethroned ruler.

Our correspondent contacted Goodluck Idele, the chair of the local government area, but he seemed too confused to speak. Mr. Idele, who hails from the troubled community, merely said, “Please I can’t talk to you now, Please I can’t talk to you.” The tone was a departure from his recent confident statement that peace would soon be restored to Uzere.

Some people in Uzere accused the chairman of taking sides in the escalating discord within the community as well as acting the script handed down by his masters. However, one source said that Mr. Idele had apologized two weeks ago to the community.

Today’s violence is the latest in a string of disturbances that has plagued Uzere since the two-year crisis began. Uzere residents have had a running battle with Shell Petroleum over oil spillage as well as the destruction of the community’s traditional means of livelihood.

Nigeria's military says it killed 20 Boko Haram Islamists while repelling an attack by the extremist group in the embattled northeastern state of Borno.

""Boko Haram terrorists attempted to attack a military barracks (in Borno) at about 5am"" (1500 AEDT) on Sunday, spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa said in a statement.

He said the attack occurred in the village of Monguno, about 200km from Borno's restive capital of Maiduguri, considered Boko Haram's home base where the radical group has been blamed for scores of deadly attacks.

The raid on the military barracks ""was repelled"", Musa said. ""The encounter led to the deaths of 20 Boko Haram terrorists.""

He said the gunmen, armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenade launchers had stormed the military site in three 4X4 trucks and eight motorcycles.

Boko Haram's insurgency is estimated to have left 3000 people dead since 2009, including killings by the security forces.

The Islamists have said they are fighting to create an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north, but their demands have repeatedly shifted.

A video posted on YouTube last month featured gunmen claiming to be from Boko Haram who said they abducted a French family of seven from a Cameroon nature park near the Nigerian border.

The video marked a departure for the Islamist group, which had never before claimed the kidnapping of a Westerner and some have questioned whether the Nigerian Islamists did in fact carry out the abductions.

France has said Boko Haram is responsible for the attack and is likely holding the family members, including four children, in Nigeria."

Some hoodlums, numbering about 10, invaded the Palace of Olu of Igbokoda in the Ilaje Local Government of Ondo State on Saturday and vandalised the structure.

Our correspondent learnt that the hoodlums, who were armed with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, threatened to attack the traditional ruler of the town, Oba Afolabi Odidiomo.

According to a source, the invasion of the palace was a reprisal by the hoodlums, who wanted to revenge the death of one of them.

The source said some of the thugs had earlier invaded Ilaje High School in the town, where an inter school quiz and sport competition was disrupted on Friday.

Two of the hoodlums were arrested and taken to the palace, where they were handed over to the police.

Odidiomo alleged that the attack on his palace was masterminded by a prominent monarch in the area.

He traced the genesis of the attack to some few months after his installation, when Amepetu of Mahin installed two people within Igbokoda as Baale and Oloja.

The monarch explained that he frowned on the development since the two chiefs lived within his domain.

He claimed the Amapetu allegedly ordered some boys, known as ‘Mahin Task Force’, to provide security for the two chiefs.

He said, “I reported the development to Olugbo of Igboland, Oba Obateru Akinruntan, who promised to wade in the matter.

“There was also a parcel of land within Igbokoda, which was sold to the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs at about N64m without my knowledge.

“I sent a petition to the ministry on the issue. A group of boys shot into my room through the window last year in an attempt to eliminate me.”

The monarch, however, said two of the hoodlums, who were apprehended by the people of Igbokoda last week for disturbing the peace of the town, had been handed over to the police.

The Amapetu could not be reached for comments but one of his chiefs in the kingdom, Chief Francis Mesagan, described the attack on the palace of Olu of Igbokoda as unfortunate.

The chief said, “Oba Omowole of Mahin kingdom single-handedly installed Odidiomo as the monarch of Igbokoda and will not be party to destroying the house he built.

He said the discovery of the corpse of the boy found in the river ignited the attack on Olu of Igbokoda’s palace by the people of the community and not from external forces, as claimed by the Odidiomo.

But Odidiomo maintained that the plot was hatched outside Igbokoda.

He said, “This is part of a sustained activities to rubbish me. Last November, they shot at me right in my bedroom.

Meanwhile, police authorities on Sunday confirmed the arrest and detention of eight people in connection with the attack on the Olu of Igbokoda and the destruction of his palace.

The Public Relations Officer of the state command, Mr. Wole Ogodo, said apart from three people, who were arrested on Saturday, additional five people were picked up on Sunday.

He said, “We cannot ascertain the financial implication of the property destroyed but it is very bad. The action is condemnable.

“All the eight people arrested are being investigated at the state CID to know their level of involvement.”"

This brings to 55 the number of persons killed in the state in recent time.

The killings came as the state Governor Jonah Jang on Thursday asked the Defence Headquarters to monitor the activities of men of the Special Task Force to ensure that their operations were within the rules of their engagement.

The STF maintains peace in Plateau as well as Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local governments in Bauchi State.

Our correspondent gathered that the gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, who raided Atakar at about 8pm, claimed they were on bee hunting.

Not comfortable with the kinds of guns the herdsmen were carrying for a bee-hunting expedition, some villagers confronted them. In the ensuing argument, the gunmen allegedly killed five persons.

The incident was said to have angered the natives, who mobilised and chased the gunmen out of the village.

However, the gunmen were said to have returned to the village in larger number on Thursday morning, killing another two persons in Atakar, and 13 others in neighbouring Dajak village.

Member, representing Riyom in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Mr. Daniel Dem, who confirmed the incident, described the attackers as mercenaries.

He said no security had been sent to Dajak because of its hilly terrain.

Meanwhile, Jang, represented by his deputy, Ignatius Longjan, spoke in Jos when a delegation from the Defence Headquarters, led by Commodore Yusuf Hela, visited the state.

The governor said, “The STF men must strive to operate by the rules of their engagement. This is very necessary to erode public skepticism on their operations of late.

“The peace enjoyed in the state has been punctured lately and there appears to be more complaints against some STF personnel.”

Meanwhile, the state government has condemned the Tuesday attacks by gunmen on Mavo village in Wase Local Government Area during which eight people lost their lives.

The state Commissioner for Information and Communication, Mr. Abraham Yiljap, who decried the incident, described the fresh attack as “very sad, coming at a time all stakeholders have committed themselves to a peaceful Plateau’’.

He said, “What happened in Wase is so sad, painful and tragic. This government is very sad because that incident came up when we are on the verge of restoring permanent peace on the Plateau. Such kind of deadly confrontation among people that have lived together for ages is sad and government is pained by it.’’

Yiljap said normalcy had returned to the area, and advised the people to be alert always.

He added, “I have been in touch with the Commander of the STF as well as the commissioner of the Plateau Police command and have confirmed that sufficient men have been deployed to secure the affected areas.’’"

At the end of the attack, late Friday, no fewer than 25 persons, including a former commissioner in old Gongola State, were feared dead.

Scene of attack was the headquarters of Ganye local government.

The suspected insurgents hit Adamawa just as another suicide attack was foiled by security agents in Kano yesterday.

Only the two suicide bombers involved in the attack were, however, killed.

Gunmen also shot dead a security guard in Maiduguri, Borno State capital, yesterday, bringing the death toll from suspected terror attacks at the weekend to 28.

The other highlight of the Adamawa incident was that the gunmen, who carried out the operation, attacked a bank, a police station and a prisons facility where some inmates were said to have been freed.

Some relaxation centers and hotels, a source said, were also hit.

The bulk of those killed were said to have been shot during the attack on the relaxation centers and hotels.

Adamawa killings

Eye witnesses said the attackers first struck at the divisional police station which was set ablaze before proceeding to the prisons where the inmates were set free and the building also set on fire.The attack, according to the eyewitnesses, which took the residents by surprise, began moments after the last Muslim prayers, Isha'i. The attackers were shouting, ""Allah is Great, Allah is Great', as they marched round the town unchallenged.At the bank, the assailants were reported to have used dynamites to pull down parts of the building before gaining entrance into the banking hall and the strong room.

At press time, there was no confirmation of the amount of money stolen from the bank but reports said the amount could run into millions of Naira. Almost all the hotels and other relaxation joints in the town were set ablaze and ransacked, even as fun seekers ran helter skelter for dear lives.

Sunday Vanguard learnt that most of the casualties were recorded in the relaxation centres as the attackers opened fire sporadically on people seen to be patronizing the drinking joints and their owners. Adamawa State Police Command confirmed the incident. The command's public relations officer, PPRO Mohammed Ibrahim (SP), said military and police personnel had been dispatched to the area. Also, the Comptroller of Prisons in charge of Adamawa State, Mr. Andrew Barka, confirmed the ransacking of Ganye Prisons, but failed to give further details.Ganye local government council shares border with the Republic of Cameroon.

Wheel barrow bombers

In Kano, operatives of military Joint Task-Force (JTF), yesterday morning, allegedly foiled the attempt by two suicide bombers to blow up the counter terrorism personnel manning a checkpoint, leaving the bombers dead.

Security sources said the bombers had disguised as water vendors pushing through a wheel barrow loaded with high caliber Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and were approaching the checkpoint located at the Eastern bypass by the petrol mega station when they were ordered to stop. They allegedly refused.

The source stated that the military personnel, who appeared curious about the 'water vendors,"" shot and killed the two suspects instantly, while a shot fired at the wheel barrow resulted in a deafening explosion that unsettled the restive commercial city forcing residents to retreat to the comfort of their homes.

Sunday Vanguard learnt that the JTF immediately cordoned off the scene and mobilized men and heavy weaponry there.

Confirming the incident, the Kano State Police Command stated that four people were arrested within the vicinity.

The Command, in a statement by the state police commissioner, Alhaji Musa Daura, said investigations had commenced to ascertain those involved.

Death in black spot

In the Maiduguri attack, gunmen, suspected to be members of Boko Haram, attacked the Kaleri

ward residence of a businessman, Alhaji Umar Ali Adam Kolo, and shot dead his chief security officer at about 1.45pm yesterday.

Kaleri ward of the metropolis, according to (JTF) sources, is one of the eight black spot areas of Boko Haram in the Borno State capital.

The chief security officer, according to an eyewitness, was trailed to his duty post at the compound on a tricycle immediately after the afternoon mosque prayers, and shot in the head and chest. He slumped and died on the spot.

The eye witness said the suspects came through the Shehuri North areas, before riding into the Kaleri ward on a tricycle, chanting: ""God is great! God is great!,"" in Arabic language, before they shot and killed the security guard.

A resident said the security guard was early this year issued a threat letter to vacate his duty post of protecting his boss.

The murder seemed to have revived the specter of political killings that was the feature of the state before the advent of this new political dispensation, the last being that of Alhaji Lateef Salako (aka Elewe omo), the NURTW kingpin in December 2010. A visibly shaken Adeniran told Daily Sun that he was surprised when he arrived the house at about 6.58am and knocked on the gate, only to get no response for almost 30 minutes.

“We normally resume shifts by 7.00am and 7.00pm. So when I came and knocked, there was no answer. There was no sign of his footsteps, or radio set, which he normally left on. I stayed for about 30 minutes outside, when Usman, a neigbour’s security guard next to us advised I should knock again, because it was unusual of Baba not to come out by that time. It was then I used my hands to pry open the gate from behind.

As I entered it was Baba’s dead body that I saw lying at his post near the entrance. He was tied. I quickly raised alarm and called Oga’s secretary and his special Assistant.” Speaking on phone with Daily Sun from Ado Ekiti, Adigun said he got a telephone call yesterday morning informing him of the incident. He believed he was the target, as nothing was stolen from the house. The main building was not even broken into.

He said he had no clue why anyone would make attempt on his life, but suspected that it might have political undertone. His words: “I don’t have deals. I owed no one and no one owed me any money. I hardly have enemies, but I know I criticize government a lot. “This is a dangerous trend, that we are having this kind of thing again in this state. Apparently, they were after me, because we learnt they came about 9.00pm and 10.00pm, when they calculated I would have dispersed my visitors and would be relaxing.

They calculated the time,” he said he would henceforth seek police protection. Asked to comment on the incident, the politician’s aged mother, who, however, refused to give her name told Daily Sun: “My son, what do I say. Just help me to thank God and pray that the poor man who was killed, let God give him eternal rest.” Pressed further, the old woman, who would turn 75 years on April 1, said she was happy that the agents of evil did not give her a sad birthday present. She disclosed that her son had been receiving death threats since early December last year, but had ignored advice that he abandons the house for a while.

The last time I told him, he just shrugged off his shoulders, that he could not because of some faceless people leave and not celebrate Christmas in his own house, that such people should come and meet him.” The murdered guard’s colleague, Adeniran said the assailants apparently accessed the house by scaling the fence from the back. Conducting Daily Sun round the premises, he showed the reporter the ladder the hoodlums might have used to climb back the fence and make good their escape.

He also showed the bloodstained spot where he discovered his dead colleague. The corpse had been deposited at the Adeoyo Maternity and State Hospital Yemetu, while the matter was reported at the Akobo Police Station. When Daily Sun visited the police station, the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, was said not to be around. But, a police officer confirmed the case was reported there and that investigation was on. 10/newsrm2 10 in police net for forging approved plan From CHARLES ADEGBITE, Ado-Ekiti No fewer than 10 people are now being prosecuted in Ekiti State for allegedly contravening urban and physical development law and forging government approved plan in Ekiti State.

The state Commissioner for Housing, Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr. Oluremi Olorunleke disclosed this in Ado-Ekiti yesterday during the ministerial press briefing/stakeholders’ forum Olorunleke lamented that those being prosecuted have been forging government documents and using them to dupe innocent people looking for approved government plan and Certificate of Occupancy (C of O),

He charged whoever wants to get approved Survey Plan and C of O to come to the Bureau of Land and contact the officers in charge, rather than allowing some crooks to dupe them, saying the Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has approved about 482 C of O since inception of his administration. Speaking on the need for Master Plan, the commissioner said: “It is disheartening that there is no master plan for Ado-Ekiti as a state capital in our 17 years of existence.

A master plan and other types or level of plans are basic tools of projection, monitoring and assumption of ordering of development of a city or country.” The ministry, according to the commissioner had generated about N227 million between January 2012 and February 2013; which was more than what it generated between October 2010 and Dec 2011.

On the activities of the Ekiti State Housing Corporation, the commissioner disclosed that the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) granted the corporation, a loan facility to the tune of N794.6 million to develop 281 housing units in the state. He, however, said the money had not been disbursed “because the state has not resumed contributing to the National Housing Fund, NHF."

Police in Ekiti State have arrested two persons for their alleged involvement in the killing of Mr. Ayo Jeje, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state.

The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Sotonye Wakama, said this while speaking with our correspondent on Monday.

He noted however that the police had yet to get any evidence against the suspects.

The commissioner of police said, “We have arrested two persons. We went to Erijiyan and they pointed two men to us. They said that the two suspects were part of those who fired shots during the mayhem. Further investigation will show if they were culpable or not.”

Wakama noted that peace had returned to the town, which came under attack from some hoodlums on Saturday.

He warned politicians to desist from violence, warning that the police would not hesitate to deal with anyone caught perpetrating violence in the state.

Wakama said the command had earlier called leaders of the various political parties to a meeting to make sure that violence did not recur in the state.

Violence broke out in Erijiyan Ekiti on Saturday night when some hoodlums allegedly attacked some former members of the Action Congress of Nigeria, who were to defect to the Peoples Democratic Party.

State PDP Chairman, Mr. Makanjuola Ogundipe, blamed the attacked on the ruling party, while his CAN counterpart, Chief Jide Awe, said the crisis was a result of intra-party crisis, which had rocked the opposition party."

Two persons have been confirmed dead in Bamabam and Maitunku villages following a communal clash between the two communities of Dadiya and Waja in Balanga Local Government Area of Gombe State. A source told Sunday Sun that several houses were burnt in Bamabam village near Gombe-Yola road, as passengers could not pass through the village from either side of the road. Police Public Relations Officer, Gombe State Police Command, Fwaje Atajiri (DSP), confirmed the incident to newsmen in Gombe.

Atajiri said regular and mobile policemen were drafted to the villages to restore normalcy. The police spokesman did not disclose the cause of the crisis and extent of damage. It was learnt that the problem started when a Waja man was allegedly killed four days ago in Maitunku village. When the Waja man’s body could not be found in Maitunku village on Friday by his kinsmen, they came back to Bamabam village where fracas ensued between the two tribes, resulting in the use of dangerous weapons, which included guns.

A reliable source told our correspondent that it was during a shootout that another person was killed while angry youths burnt houses in Bambam village, a situation that attracted armed policemen. At the time of filing this report, the village was said to be calm while the PPRO promised to reach reporters with findings from the police."

Peace was momentarily disturbed at Ijapo/Oke-Ijebu and Plaza areas of Akure on Tuesday evening, following the killing of a pregnant woman by a police man. Some policemen were said to have been at Ijapo/Okeijebu junction, directing vehicular traffic when his gun , AK-47 rifle, suddenly fell down and started discharging bullets.

The police officers took to their heels to avoid being hit by the bullets while other people around ran in different directions for safety. One of the bullets from the gun hit a pregnant woman who was inside a commercial bus and she allegedly died instantly. The policemen carried the pregnant woman to a nearby hospital where she was confirmed dead by the doctor on duty. Apparently angered by the development, youths in the areas mobilized themselves and attacked one of the policemen when he came back to pick up the gun. He was manhandled before his colleagues called for reinforcement and rescued him.

The police action, however, worsened the situation as angry youths thereafter set ablaze the police post at Ijapo and destroyed the gate to the Estate. They later moved to the divisional police station Ijapo where they sacked the police officers on duty. The Ijapo axis of Oke-Ijebu area was barricaded while bonfires were made in some of the critical junctions by the angry youths.

The men of the Nigeria Army Fast-Track squad 35 Artillery Brigade, Akure who came to rescue the embattled police officers had a hectic time preventing the youths from setting the police station ablaze. Meanwhile, women lawyers, Akure chapter yesterday staged a protest over the death of the pregnant woman. The lawyers described the killing as callous and wicked by the police officer, warning the police to desist from wasting innocent souls.

The killer policeman has been arrested and detained at the state CID for integration. Command spokesman Wole Ogodo ( ASP) while confirming the story said the police officer had faced orderly trial and he had been dismissed from the police force The PPRO said that the killer police will be charged to court today (Thursday ) for murder He said the police will not tolerate any act of indiscipline capable of denting the image of the police adding that any police officer who involve any act of indiscipline will be summarily dismissed"

A soldier attached to the Joint Task Force, JTF, in the Niger Delta and two suspected kidnappers were yesterday killed in a gun battle between the JTF and suspected kidnappers in Okpara Inland in Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta State. Checks by our correspondent revealed that the JTF had stormed a suspected hideout of the hoodlums in the Urhobo community, following a tip-off that they were holding a clandestine meeting in the area. It was learnt that the troops had invaded the scene, hoping that a wanted militant kingpin in the state, popularly known as Kelvin was presiding over the forum.

Although Kelvin was not at the meeting, reports indicated that his lieutenants, who got wind of the JTF mission, instantly engaged them in a shoot-out. Consequently, one of the soldiers and two of the hoodlums lost their lives at the end of the gun battle. But the JTF recorded another feat as it arrested 11 of the criminals.

They were being interrogated at the Delta Sector Command of the JTF located at 3rd Battalion, David Ejooh Barracks, Effurun, the headquarters of Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, as at the time of filing this report yesterday.

National Mirror gathered that concerted efforts of the state government and the security agencies to apprehend Kelvin, said to be the brain behind high profile cases of kidnapping and killings in the state, were futile. The efforts had resulted in frequent raid of Kokori community, Ethiope East Local Government Area, where the kingpin hails from. His father, whom the police attempted to arrest in proxy, ran to the court, which eventually granted an interim order restraining the police, for cover."

The market was hurriedly closed as traders scampered for safety. Motorists and other road users also fled to avoid being hit by the gunmen’s bullets.

It will be recalled that 18 vigilance group members were killed by gunmen at the Damboa market for allegedly selling pork in February. Damboa is 87 kilometres south of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, and an epicentre of the Boko Haram sect.

According to a motorist, who was trapped in the barricaded road, the gunmen, changing Allahu Akbar (God is great), began firing at pedestrians and motorists before men of the Joint Task Force (JTF) came to repel them.

Gunmen

Fresh crisis on Monday broke out in Zango and Wase, in Wase Local Government of Plateau State leaving over least 27 persons dead.

This is the third time that violence, which pitted Hausa/Fulani against their Taroh neighbours, broke out in the area.

Our correspondent gathered that a group of armed youths attempted to ambush Wase on Monday evening but were repelled by the community’s youths and vigilance groups.

A source said, “We heard gunshots being fired into our community and everybody started running, but we were able to chase the militants across Zango and burnt their camps around the area.”

A member of a Community Development Association from Yelwa Shendam, Alhaji Abdullahi Danbaba, who spoke on the incident, said he narrowly escaped the attack on his way to Yelwa.

He said from information he gathered, that over 27 persons were killed.

Tarok traditional ruler, Jessey Pyenkwam, told newsmen that he was informed a Tarok settlement had been razed down completely.

Spokesman for the Special Task Force, Capt. Salisu Mustapha, confirmed to our correspondent that there had been attacks around Wase but could not give the casualty figure.

Meanwhile, Special security outfit in the state, the Special Task Force, has intensified search for illegal arms and ammunition in the state.

Commander of the STF, Maj. Gen. Henry Ayoola, said during a briefing at the Defence Headquarters in Abuja on Monday that the security outfit had seized a lot of arms and ammunition, including AK 47 assault rifles and locally made guns.

He said the proliferation of small arms in Plateau was a source of concern, especially to the men of the STF entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the peace in the state.

The STF commander pointed out that even the locally made arms seized by the STF members had the capacity to use the same 7.62 mm ammunition used by the security operatives.

He warned that the STF would arrest anybody caught with illegal possession of arms and ammunition.

He said, “The issue of small arms proliferation is of great concern to everybody in the Plateau especially to us that are saddled with the security of lives and property.

“However, we solve this problem through automatic cordon and search operation through which we have got several arms and ammunition.

“The adversaries, (that are what we have to call them now), are using other methods. There is need for a larger level of disarmament as was the case in the Niger Delta.

He said the crisis in Jos was political and a struggle for access to resources with some level of ethnic and religious colourations.

Also, Senator representing Plateau South Senatorial District, Victor Lar, has called on the STF and other security apparatus to intervene in stopping the violence in the district.

Lar, who spoke to our correspondent on the telephone from his home in Jos on Monday, said the renewed violence in his domain had undermined the peace that had been gained over time."
1355,Nigerian army says kills 6 Islamist insurgents in raid,4/12/2013,Kano,,Kano,7,,State Actor,,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gun,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,http://news.yahoo.com/nigerian-army-says-kills-6-islamist-insurgents-raid-082938160.html,,,,,", Kano, Nigeria",Nigeria,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian soldiers killed six suspected Islamist insurgents during a raid on a house in the main northern city of Kano on Friday but lost one soldier in the gun battle, the military said.

Radical sect Boko Haram and other Islamist groups have become the main threat to stability in Africa's top oil-producer and a growing menace to neighbours like Cameroon.

Boko Haram has killed many hundreds in gun and bomb attacks, including 25 in Kano last month, since it intensified an insurgency two years ago, with the aim of carving an Islamic state out of religiously mixed Nigeria.

""During the operation this morning a soldier and six terrorists were killed,"" military task force spokesman Ikedichi Iweha told reporters.

Nigeria's military rarely admits significant casualties amongst its own ranks or civilian deaths in shootouts.

Iweha said soldiers recovered weapons, including improvised explosive devices, before demolishing the house where the insurgents were living.

Western governments fear that ties with groups like al Qaeda's North African wing are pulling Nigerian Islamists towards a more explicitly anti-Western agenda.

Al Qaeda-affiliated Nigerian group Ansaru said last month it had killed seven foreign hostages seized on February 7 in the northern state of Bauchi because of attempts to free them.

A French family was kidnapped from north Cameroon in February and is believed held by Boko Haram in Nigeria.

Northern traditional leaders have appealed to President Goodluck Jonathan to declare an amnesty for Boko Haram fighters who lay down their weapons, like the one that ended years of militancy in the southern oil-producing Niger Delta.

Presidency sources say Jonathan is considering such a move, but he has said in the past the Islamists must identify themselves, which so far they have been unwilling to do."

No fewer than three people were feared dead while over 70 persons sustained various degrees of injury in a communal clash in Cross River communities.

The two neighbouring communities of Ajasor and Efraya in Etung Local Government Area went to war penultimate week over a parcel of land located at government reservation area (GRA).

It was gathered that the two communities had tried to initiate series of peace moves to forestall shedding of blood just as top government officials had meetings with the youths of the communities over the disputed land.

Daily Sun investigations revealed that Ajasor people had first launched an attack on their Efraya neighbours killing two persons and destroying cash crops and houses even when peace moves were still on. Angered by this development, the Efraya youths moved in and allegedly killed one person and destroyed houses, domestic animals and farms.

A community leader, who did not want his name in print, confided in Daily Sun that three lives were lost and property worth millions of thousands of naira lost.

The youth leader disclosed that for over a week, economic activities had been paralysed while women and children had fled to nearby villages for safety. Reacting during matter of urgent public interest on the floor of the House of Assembly, the member representing Etung State Constituency, Clement Ogisa Okongo, lamented that the two communities were in disarray and that all economic and social activities had been halted due to the clash.

He informed the House that the two communities were at each others’ throats over a piece of land in a Government Reservation Area and wondered why this had to happen when none of the communities in question had any title deed to the disputed parcel of land. Owing to the motion, the House resolved that the forestry commission should take possession of the land to avoid further incursions since the land in question was under their supervision.

The House called on security agencies to move to the area to stop the hostilities while also appealing to SEMA to send relief materials to cushion the effect of the fight and also address health issues. While lending his voice to the matter, the speaker of the House, Larry Odey called on the elite and traditional rulers to swiftly rise and tackle challenges like this, saying such steps would avert crises and would go a long way to reduce communal clashes.

Two years ago, Boje and Nsadop communities both in Boki Local Government Area of the state also fought over land in which more than 10 people lost their lives."

Sunday Tribune learnt that the gunmen killed many students of Monguno Secondary School by slitting their throats, after laying an ambush for them as they returned home from centres where they wrote the West African Examination Council (WAEC) Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE).

Monguno is 135 kilometres North of Maiduguri, the state capital; and it is considered to be an epicentre of activities of the Islamist sect.

The gunmen, according to a villager, Mallam Aisami, ambushed the candidates on their way home on foot and bicycles. He added that the assailants tied the students’ hands together at their backs and slit their throats on the foot paths leading to the school premises in the afternoon.

He said when the dastardly deed had been done, the gunmen fled on three motorcycles towards Marte Local Government Area of Northern Borno before men of the Joint Task Force (JTF) rushed to the scene three hours after the students were already slew.

Spokesman of JTF, Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, and the Borno State Commissioner for Education, Alhaji Musa Inuwa Kubo, confirmed the incident on Saturday.

They stated that it was a very “unfortunate and frightening incident,” decrying all that had been happening in the state.

Sagir and Kubo could, however, not ascertain the exact number of students allegedly killed by the suspects at Monguno.

Kubo, in a telephone interview, told journalists that; “I am calling on the people of Borno State to continue to pray and fast so that the incessant attacks and killings in the state cease peace and unity are restored.

“I pray that the trying and challenging times of insecurity of lives and property here in Borno will come to an end soon, by God’s willing and the full support of our leaders in the state.”

Sunday Tribune also learnt from JTF sources that; “until political leaders, along with traditional and religious leaders in Borno State, collectively condemn the activities of members of Boko Haram sect, there might be no peace, despite the deployment of troops and policemen to the state.”

In the meantime, Sunday Tribune investigations indicate that members of the Yoruba and Igbo communities in Borno States had been leaving their places of abode, relocating to other places considered to be safer and more secured."

Movement for Emancipation of Niger Delta on Sunday claimed responsibility for the destruction of Oil Well 62 belonging to the Shell Petroleum Development Company in Ewellesuo, Nembe Local Government of Bayelsa State.

The militant group said the attack, which occurred on Saturday about 1am, was part of its Operation Hurricane Exodus.

MEND, in an electronic mail by its spokesman, Gbomo Jomo, also announced its readiness to commence fresh hostilities to save Christians from Boko Haram violence.

MEND codenamed the new hostilities, which it said would begin on May 31 and would target mosques and Islamic clerics, as Operation Barbarossa.

The attack on the well head occurred barely a week after MEND claimed responsibility for the killing of 12 policemen along the Azuzuama waterways in Southern Ijaw Local Government of the state.

Before the militant group claimed responsibility for the oil well damage, the community had raised the alarm over massive oil spillage from well 62.

Members of the community reportedly accused SPDC of failing to clamp the spill points to avoid further environmental damage.

The Chairman of the Oil and Gas Committee of Nembe Kingdom, Mr. Nengi James, said he appealed to the people to remain calm.

“Since I became Chairman of the Oil and Gas Committee in the kingdom, I have witnessed over 10 massive oil spillages. And all these spillages have never been cleaned up by the oil company.”

But MEND, which claimed responsibility for the spill, said it had concluded plans to rescue Christians from Boko Haram insurgency.

The statement said, “On behalf of the hapless Christian population in Nigeria, The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta will from Friday, May 31, 2013, embark on a crusade to save Christianity in Nigeria from annihilation.

“The bombings of mosques, hajj camps, Islamic instututions, large congregations in islamic events and assasinations of clerics that propagate doctrines of hate, will form the core mission of this crusade code named Operation Barbarossa.”

Meanwhile, the Joint Task Force in the Niger Delta codenamed Operation Pulo Shield has debunked claims by the MEND that it was responsible for renewed hostilities in the region.

JTF’s Media Coordinator, Lt. Col. Onyema Nwachukwu, said “impostors and a bundle of never-do-wells” were hiding under MEND, which, he said had gone into extinction after the amnesty deal, to perpetrate criminal activities in the region.

He also asked members of the public to discountenace claims by MEND that it had designed a special operation in sympathy for the Christians."

According to the source, ""the occupants who were mostly native Tiv farmers were travelling from Gbajimba to Makurdi at about 11am when the heavily armed herdsmen waylaid and opened fire on them, killing two on the spot. Four of the passengers managed to escape, while seven others were chased into the bush by the assailants.

""Our fear at the moment is that those that were chased into the bush might have been killed because no one knows their whereabouts and their families are yet to trace them.

Armed militants who are regrouping in Bayelsa State struck again on Saturday when they attacked Lobia community in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State and engaged in a fierce gun battle, killing eight people, including a sibling of an ex-militant leader, Pastor Reuben Wilson.

Southern Ijaw has been identified by intelligence operatives of the Joint Military Task Force (JTF), Operation Pulo Shield, as the breeding ground of the so-called new Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND).

The new group, which is made up former soldiers in various camps of ex-militant leaders, but headed by a former commander in the Young Shall Grow Camp, has been fingered in the recent killing of 12 policemen.

They have also been linked with the increasing wave of sea robbery and kidnapping along the major waterways in Southern Ijaw.

Based on its intelligence report, the JTF stormed the area recently and clamped down on seven hideouts, seizing some military uniforms, communication gadgets, arms and ammunition.

Sources in Lobia community said five of those killed were youths who had embraced amnesty and have been integrated back into the society.

There are two versions on how the eight people died, with one version saying they were tricked into the creeks while another version said they engaged in a shootout.

A community source said the boys were tricked by some people close to the creeks where they were shot dead by gunmen.

According to the source, it is strongly believed that the alleged killers of the 12 policemen, who had escaped from their hideouts in Azuzuama, were responsible for the latest killing to thwart investigation by the police to trace their whereabouts using repentant militants.

Friends and relatives of the deceased believe that they were deliberately set-up to be killed by the gunmen.

“Our brothers were set up by some persons in the Lobia community. The report we gathered showed that after they were killed,” a source said.

Pastor Rueben, whose 37-year-old younger brother, Judah Benaibi Wilson, was among those killed, had recently alleged that anti-President Goodluck Jonathan forces had planned to destabilize Bayelsa State and the Niger Delta region, using renegade ex-militants to launch crisis.

At Rueben Wilson’s house, scores of mourners gathered consoling the family members over the death of Wilson’s younger brother.

Wilson, who confirmed the story, was in a pensive mood as he was surrounded by his close associates.

The media coordinator of the JTF, Lt. Col N. Nwachukwu, who also confirmed the incident, however, stated that there was a shootout.

Nwachukwu said: “At about 2am on Sunday there was an armed collision between two armed groups at Lobia 1 in Southern Ijaw Area which led to the death of unspecified number of persons. Our troops have carried out a cordon and search operation in the community and recovered items including two AK 47 riffles, One GPMG barrel, six AK47 Magazines, one speed boats.”"

1414,Nigerian Islamist raid in northeast town kills 55: military,5/7/2013,Bama,Bama,Borno,55,Boko Haram,State Actor,,,,,,,,13,38.0,,,,,,,,4,,,Bomb,Gun,,,,,,Government Building,,,,,,,http://www.timesofoman.com/News/Article-15001.aspx,http://www.misna.org/en/other/borno-boko-haram-launceshes-series-of-coordinated-attacks-08-05-2013-813.html,,,,"Bama, Borno, Nigeria",Nigeria,"

Bama: Suspected members of the Nigerian Islamist sect Boko Haram armed with machineguns laid siege on the northeastern town of Bama on Tuesday, freeing over 100 prison inmates and leaving 55 people dead, the military said.



Around 200 heavily armed members of Boko Haram arrived in buses and pick-up trucks and carried out a coordinated strike, first hitting the army barracks and the police station before breaking into the town's prison, military spokesman Sagir Musa said.



Musa said 22 police officers, 14 prison officials, two soldiers and four civilians were killed, while 13 of the group's own members died, in what was one of the rebel's most deadly single strikes since a 2009 uprising.



Gunmen freed 105 prisoners during the raid which began at around 5 a.m. (0400 GMT) and lasted almost five hours, Musa said. He said some of the attackers were dressed in army uniforms.



Bama's police station, army barracks and government buildings were set ablaze, he said.



""They came in army uniform pretending to be soldiers but were able to detect them,"" Musa said.



Bama is a small, remote town in northeastern Borno state, Boko Haram's home state and the nucleus of its attacks.



""The call to prayer was just being said at about 5 a.m. when the Boko Haram started shooting from all directions and we ran for our lives,"" eyewitness Amina Usman told Reuters.



""One woman who could not run burned to death,"" Usman added. The Boko Haram sect and offshoots such as the al Qaeda-linked Ansaru, as well as associated criminal networks, pose the main threat to stability in Africa's top energy producer.



Western governments are increasingly concerned about Nigerian militants linking up with other jihadist groups in the West African region.



Boko Haram wants to carve out an Islamic state in a country split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims. One of its chief demands is that its imprisoned members and family members are released and it has carried out several prison breaks.



Attacks by Boko Haram have killed more than 3,000 people since 2009, based on figures from Human Rights Watch.



Violence in Nigeria's northeast has shown no signs of abating. Clashes between Islamists and a multinational force from Nigeria, Niger and Chad killed dozens of people last month.



A senator who visited the site said 228 people were killed, but the military puts the figure at 37.



President Goodluck Jonathan has set up a committee to work out the terms of an amnesty for the rebels but their leader, Abubakar Shekau, has shown no interest in it so far.

This is just as no fewer than five Police men were reportedly shot at the weekend by irate youths who were protesting the citing of a private university by the Senate President, David Mark, at Asa 111 in Otukpo local government area of the state.

Vanguard gathered from a reliable source in Agatu that the herdsmen stormed Okpachanyi village on Sunday Morning at the middle of the burial rites and shot sporadically at the mourners, killing their victims at the spot while many escaped with bullet wounds.

""The burial rites of the two slain Police men were going on at Okpachanyi village when the armed herdsmen stormed the scene and opened fire on the mourners, killing and maiming the people while many escaped with bullet wounds,"" he said.

At the time of filing this report, the state government had dispatched the Deputy Governor, Chief Steven Lawani and top government functionaries from the area to Agatu for an on the spot assessment of the situation.

Meanwhile Vanguard gathered from an eyewitness in Otukpo that armed irate youths had last week barricaded the Otukpo/Oju federal highway in protest of the decision of their leaders to allot parcels of land to the Senate President for the erection of a new institution.

According to the source,""While Akpegede and Otobi communities gave the Senate President the go ahead to use their land, the youths in Asa 111, which is a renown hotbed for opposition politics in Benue South senatorial district, are resisting the establishment of a university in their community.

""They barricaded the road for several days which prompted the decision of the Police to intervene at the weekend with the use of teargas canisters to disperse the resilient youths in order to allow motorists and pedestrians the use of the road.

""But unfortunately, the action of the Police was resisted by the youths who fired shots at them , injuring five of the Police men in the process,"" he said.

Reacting to the development after a consultative meeting convened by the Och'Otukpo Odu, Chief John Eimonye and attended by district heads, elders, stakeholders as well as opinion leaders of Otukpo, the community frowned at the action of the youths which was considered to be militant and anti developmental and requested that the perpetrators of the dastardly act be brought to book.

In his reaction, spokesman of the community and 78 year-old retired Army Captain, Reuben Anyebe described the action of the youths as 'barbaric and unfortunate', wondering why anybody would protest the initiative of the senate president which he said has several developmental opportunities.

The chairman of Otukpo local government council, Dr Innocent Onuh who lamented the ugly development and attack on the police however commended the security operatives for their restraint even in the face of the attack.

However, Vanguard gathered from some of the irate youths of Asa 111 that they embarked on the protest to demand better compensation for their farmland which would be used for the proposed institution.

In his reaction the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO in the state, Deputy Superintendent of Police Daniel Ezeala said his office was yet to get the full details of the crisis."

The PUNCH learnt that the hoodlums threw dynamite into a building housing the council’s generating set at about 10am. The secretariat gets its supply of electricity from the attacked generator house.

The fire that resulted from the bombing of the generator house reportedly burnt down the whole building.

Chief of Staff to the Rivers State Governor Rotimi Amaechi, Mr. Tony Okocha, who visited the council after the incident, described it as the handiwork of saboteurs.

Okocha said some names had already been mentioned as suspects to security operatives for investigation.

He said, “It is just the power generating house that is in flames. From what I gathered, the fire was as a result of a dynamite thrown inside the generator house.

“The police was ordered to vacate the council, but should ensure that a minimal security was put in place. From what I can see, the police all left the place.

“I have lost confidence in the police. It is unbelievable that this is happening because the battle appears to have shifted to between the government and the police. Some names of people who masterminded the attack on the council have already been mention.”

A High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, the state capital, had on Monday ordered policemen guarding the council to vacate the place.

The court directive came on the heels of the suspension of the council chairman, Mr. Timothy Nsirim, for alleged financial impropriety and the consequent inauguration of Mr. Chikodi Dike as the caretaker committee chairman of the council.

The policemen, who had sealed-off the local government council, vacated the premises on Monday in obeisance to the court order.

Amaechi and the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers have been at loggerheads over the suspension of Nsirim.

Also, for passing the resolution to suspend the council boss, the PDP had announced the suspension of 27 lawmakers in the Rivers State House of Assembly. The House has 32 members.

A court ruling has however nullified the suspension.

When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Angela Agabe, confirmed the incident and added that the police had vacated the council based on a court order.

Agabe explained that the state police command had deployed some policemen in the area to the place to forestall a recurrence of the incident.

“It is a generator house that was affected. The court said police should vacate the place. We have, however, posted two or three policemen to the council to forestall any recurrence of the fire incident,” the police spokesperson said."

Similarly, they demanded that the state government should stop the military operatives from invading or tormenting them day and night as they had done in the past during which they came with a list of names and at times arrest and instantly kill residents without interrogation.

In their explanation to the visiting team, they claimed that there were never any instance of religious conflict in the areas, neither was there any trace of Boko Haram among the residents.

However, the state government appealed to them to return to their homes, and assured them that peace would surely return to the areas. He asked the people to forward to the state government within 24 hours the names of selected youths for registration to take over security of their areas as obtained in Maiduguri town where youths have taken over security checkpoints and were arresting returning Boko Haram insurgents.

Emboldened by last weekend’s courage when they confronted gun-wielding Boko Haram members, angry youths in Maiduguri, Borno State, yesterday combed the metropolis, seeking to smoke out the insurgents from their hide-out.

Armed with machetes and sticks, the residents said that they have had enough of the activities of the dreaded insurgents. The youths arrested many of the sect members yesterday and handed them over to security agents.

The action, according to one of the leaders, Abubakar Maulum, was fueled by the courage displayed by a group of youths at Hausari, a renowned Boko Haram den last weekend. Some of the youths were said to have apprehended eight gunmen believed to be Boko Haram members that attacked and killed about 13 people on Friday and handed them over to the Joint Task Force (JTF) troops. The gunmen, who reportedly pretended to be driving to a burial site, and had weapons hidden in a coffin, came to the area, off-loaded the arms and opened fire at unsuspecting residents.

Meanwhile, some youths who were seen yesterday in some parts of the metropolis with machete and sticks said: “Enough is enough,” noting that the residents and the state have suffered for long in the hands of the dreaded sect. “We are tired of this and we want to put an end to it. Since soldiers don’t really know who the Boko Haram members are, then, we who live with them and know them very well, have resolved that we have no option than to help fish them out,” Abubakar said.

One of his lieutenants, Isa Musa, said he decided to join the vanguard to apprehend the Boko Haram men to save more lives. When reminded that he was trying to fish out armed men with only sticks and cutlasses, Isa said he believed God’s power was more than human tools. “I know, but God’s power is stronger. Just pray for us in this battle because we are ready to lose our lives to save more lives. We are into this to save our people from Boko Haram who had killed our people, security operatives and destroyed our economy; we are not afraid of them because we are doing a just cause and God is on our side.”

The youths said they have arrested many of the sect members and handed them over to security forces in the town and where they are hiding. ‘We have lost count of how many insurgents we have caught and handed over to the soldiers and we are going after more of them. We caught one recently and when he was investigated, the security operatives found huge amount of money in his bank account”. The youth leader said that he was hit by a stray bullet from the sect in a recent attack.

Also at Gwange, some youths apprehended a young man in his house and handed him over to the JTF around the NEPA area. “The man is in his early 30s and his mother followed the crowd of youths, begging them, but nobody bulged,” an eyewitness said.

Meanwhile, two Boko Haram suspects were on Monday shot dead while attempting to escape from JTF custody. Eyewitnesses said the suspects escaped from the custody of the task force around the Post Office area.

“One of the suspects strolled into a crowded Post Office area where taxis and tricycles were dropping and picking commuters. Unfortunately, he was in handcuffs and this drew the attention of people around the area. But soldiers who were already trailing him came and as the guy was attempting to flee, the soldiers fired at him and he fell down. His corpse was picked by the police later with the body of the another suspect in the vehicle,” eyewitness said."

Nigerian forces are engaged in a 4-week-old operation to regain territory from fighters loyal to Islamist group Boko Haram, which they say has enabled them to wrest back control of the country's remote northeast.

They also say they have destroyed key bases and arrested more than 150 suspected insurgents in the states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa -- all covered by a state of emergency declared by President Goodluck Jonathan last month.

Islamist groups like Boko Haram and the al Qaeda-linked Ansaru have become the biggest risk to stability in Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer and second largest economy, and some Nigerians saw the military push as long overdue.

But rights groups and aid agencies fear the longer it goes on, the more the region's vulnerable local population, which includes some of the poorest people on earth, will suffer.

""Those UNHCR has spoken to say they escaped for fear of being caught in the government-led crackdown,"" notes from a UNHCR briefing in Geneva said, adding that they had reported air strikes were continuing near Lake Chad, where Nigeria borders Chad, Cameroon and Niger.

The military was not immediately available for comment, but in a statement on Friday defence spokesman Brigadier-General Chris Olukolade denied a report that Nigerian refugees were ""pouring into"" Niger.

The UNHCR said Niger had received 2,692 Nigerian citizens, with another 3,544 originally from Niger but who were living in Nigeria, and 94 people of other nationalities, mainly Chadian.

They are ""putting a strain on meagre local food and water resources. Niger ... itself struggles with food insecurity due to years of drought,"" the U.N. agency said.

Separately, two Boko Haram suspects were shot dead on Sunday in the Gwange area of the northeast while trying to escape detention, two witnesses and a military source said.

Boko Haram militants have dispersed since the raids began, raising fears they could re-arm and return."

Nigerian police on standby.

Uyo — THE University of Uyo in Akwa Ibom State was, Wednesday, closed down indefinitely as four students were reportedly killed during violent encounter with the Police.

The students it was revealed had embarked on peaceful protest on the campus over the introduction of a new fare regime for the engineering and science students from the town campus to permanent site when the police arrived and allegedly opened fire that claimed lives of the students..

Following the killing of the students, some buildings on the town campus were burnt down last night. These included the office of the Vice Chancellor and that of the Registrar.

The Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Comfort Ekpo, was said to have travelled to Abuja on official engagement when the incident occurred.

Some Principal Officers of the University were reported to have been rescued from their hideouts through the use of ambulance escorted by the Peace on Campus Initiative of the University.

When Vanguard visited the university, students were seen rushing out from the campus with their bags and valuable items as they were ordered to vacate their hostels immediately.

Sources said trouble escalated when the students broke the rule to move their protest outside the school premises. They reportedly met a stiff resistance from security operatives at the Ikot Ekpene-Ikpa road round about.

In the violent confrontation, the police were said to have moved in with about15 Hilux vans fully loaded with armed police. They reportedly opened fired and threw tear gas cannisters on the students which resulted in the death of the four students.

The school athourity, it was gathered recently announced a new fare of N200 per day to convey students from the town campus to the permanent site with effect from yesterday through private consultancy arrangment.

Some of the students who spoke with Vanguard said they were not comfortable with some of polices being implementation in the school. A final year law student who didn't want his name in print said the police came in during the peaceful protest to shoot sporadically which led to the death of the students. He said: ""We were not armed but police came with all sorts of ammunition in a peaceful protest embarked upon by the students.""

A 300 level engineering student lamented the increase in fare which he said was not adequately communicated to the students. He noted: ""Even the vehicles were not even available when the school authority began to harass students over payment. The matter is that we do not want this VC any more. Federal Government should look for a more competent hand to govern the affairs of the school.

""How can we pay N200 for the Federal Government intervention vehicle? It is not done. We are not going to accept this.""

The Chief Security Officer, Col. Nyong (rtd) who was chased out from the campus admitted that school management brought in a private consultant to handle student transportation from the town campus to the permanent site but at the rate of N100.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) ASP Etim Dickson confirmed the riot in the University and denied knowledge of the death of any student. According to him, the situation is not clear as to what is going on in the campus as the police are not allowed to enter inside the school.

He added: ""We are outside to prevent escalation of the protest. We are aware of the demonstration, but we don't have authorization to enter campus."""

Bandits operating in Kaduna state in the early hours of yesterday killed six members of a local vigilante group shortly after ending a prayer at a mosque.

The bandits also killed two soldiers who were repelling their initial attack, while many of the bandits were killed by soldiers in the gun duel that ensured.

The incident occurred in Kwasakwasa village in Birn

in Gwari local government area, where bandits carried out attacks and killed seven persons and injured 18 others last Saturday.

The Assistant Director Army Public Relations, 1 Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Col. Sani Kukasheka Usman, confirmed that two soldiers lost their lives and two others got injured, while many of the bandits were killed by soldiers.

He however debunked insinuation that an army officer was killed in the gun duel.

Usman said: “I can confirm to you that there was an encounter between our soldiers and insurgents in Birnin Gwari area today. We lost two soldiers, and two were injured and many insurgents were killed by our team.

“As we speak, we are on top of the situation and combing the area. This is the only information at our disposal now.”

A member of the local vigilante group who escaped by the whiskers in Kwasakwasa, Muhammadu Mai Kunama, narrated how the bandits struck saying, “They came shortly after we finished morning prayer in the mosque. They were more than one hundred and they circled us and opened fire on us.

“They killed three of our members and our driver and two members inside our patrol van. In fact, they burnt them to ashes.”

On how the soldiers were killed, he said, “The soldiers were waiting for us and our other members. In the course of the exchange, they killed two soldiers and the soldiers also killed about two of them, and many of them who may have died in the forest.

“The issue is, the bandits were good in picking their wounded and dead ones. This is what I know. And we have buried our own people. It is a bad experience and we hope government will take tough actions on these people.”

When asked about the situation in the village after the incident, the vigilante member said, “There are more security agents operating now and combing the thick forest.”

Similarly, protesting youths at Yakawada Village in Giwa local government area of Kaduna state went on rampage and set the Village Head’s guest house, Alhaji Rilwanu Sama’ila, and his car ablaze yesterday.

An eye witness said that the youths were protesting the murder of a 10-year-old girl by yet to be identified persons suspected to be ritualists.

A competent source in the area told Blueprint that the incident was informed by the recovery of the deceased’s body found near the house with her private parts removed.

The source, who preferred anonymity, explained that this was the third time dead bodies of innocent people were found in the village without any measure taken by the authorities concerned.

He explained that the armed youths took to street in their hundreds to protest the development.

Our correspondent reports that heavily armed anti-riot policemen were deployed to the village to beef up security of life and property.

Confirming the incident in a telephone interview with journalists, the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Olufemi Adenaike, said that anti-riot policemen have been drafted to the village to maintain peace and order in the area.

1459,Alleged Bombing in Abuja - We Exploded Two Fuel Tankers in FCT - MEND,6/15/2013,Abuja,,Federal Capital Territory,,,,Sectarian Actor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bomb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://allafrica.com/stories/201306171453.html,,,,,", Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria",Nigeria,"THREE weeks after it called-off what it described as planned attacks on mosques and related institutions over the bombings and killing of southerners in the North by Boko Haram insurgents, the Movement for Emancipation of the Niger-Delta, MEND, claimed it struck in the early hours of Saturday in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja.

The militant group said it secretly attached portable military limpet explosives on two articulated petrol tanker vehicles outside the NNPC depot in Abaji, Abuja, at about 5.00 am and detonated the devices.

Sunday Vanguard could not verify the claim at press time while the media manager of Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidy of the NNPC, Nasir Imodagbe, denied the bombing claim.

MEND, in an electronic mail statement by its spokesperson, Jomo Gbomo, stated that its field operatives carried out the purported Abuja explosion on two oil tankers, demanding, among other things, the release of its leader, Henry Okah, and his brother, Charles, both of whom, they alleged, were set up as scapegoats by the Federal Government on the October 1, 2010 bombings in Abuja.

According to the group, ""Hurricane Exodus' resumed at about 00:05hrs on Saturday, June 15, 2013, when field operatives from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (M.E.N.D) stealthily attached portable military limpet explosives magnetically to two (2) articulated tanker vehicles laden with petrol in a queue outside the NNPC depot in Abaji, the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.""

MEND continued: ""The devices were timed to detonate simultaneously several seconds later. The outcome was predictable. This segment of Exodus codenamed, 'Operation Touch and Go', is targeted at the soft underbelly (downstream sector) of the oil industry in Nigeria.

""From today (yesterday), every tanker vehicle we find distributing petroleum products, including propane gas, has become a legitimate target in our war against injustice, corruption, despotism and oppression. Drivers of tanker vehicles continue to drive them at their own risk.""

Warning

The militant group warned, ""The public is hereby advised to maintain a safe distance from such vehicles as they can explode anytime and anywhere. Harassment on these tanker vehicles would be sustained until the following demands are met:

*Henry Okah, his brother, Charles, and other innocent persons set up as scapegoats and held over the October 01, 2010 twin car bombings in Abuja be released unconditionally.

*That an unreserved apology be tendered by the Nigerian government to MEND for presenting a forged email letter threatening the South African government purported to have originated from us and used as evidence in the sham trial and conviction of Henry Okah.

*That a separate independent body outside Nigeria investigates the forged letter so as to ascertain its authenticity and make their findings public.

*That since our struggle has never been about a Goodluck Jonathan Presidency, nor about been beneficiaries of dubious pipeline protection contracts and other forms of bribery, a conference to address the injustice, underdevelopment, environmental degradation and outstanding root issues confronting the Niger Delta region must be fixed to hold within three (3) months."""

Governor Rochas Okorocha’s convoy was attacked yesterday in Oguta Council Area of the state by youths allegedly recruited by a candidate for the rescheduled Imo House of Assembly elections scheduled to hold next week.

It gathered that Governor Okorocha, who was in Awa community in Oguta to drum up support for Chief Walter Uzonwanne, the candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) for the election slated for next week was on his way out of the community when an opposition candidate was also on his way to Awa community.

According to an eyewitness account one of the outriders on the Governor Okorocha convoy had knocked down one of the motorcyclists on the campaign train of the candidate and that instead of the security details on the governor’s convoy to assist the man, they descended on the hapless man and started beating him.

It was learnt that the attitude of the governor’s security men angered the youths, who blocked the passage of the governor as the youths reportedly descended on one of the outriders, who was beaten to stupor by the irate youths and was dispossessed him of his walkie-talkie.

“For several hours, the irate youths barricaded the road and prevented the governor’s convoy from continuing on the journey while some of them were throwing sachet water and other objects at the security operatives, who ordered them to vacate the road.”

It was further gathered that the situation could have degenerated to bloodshed but for the prompt intervention of the governor, who directed his security aides to handle the situation with utmost care.

However, when contacted, the candidate described the allegation as unfortunate, insisting that he had no powers to attack a governor’s convoy.

In his words: “I was going to Awa community to address my supporters ahead of next week’s election when I saw the governor’s convoy coming from the opposite direction. At first I thought it was the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha.

“One of the outriders knocked down one of the motorcycle riders in my campaign train and the boy was seriously wounded and instead of giving him first aid, the security men pounced on him and began to beat him and this infuriated the youths and they blocked the road and asked the governor to kill all of them.”"

It was further gathered that after being ordered out, the students started protesting, demanding to be allowed in.

When the Provost of the institution could not condone their action any longer, he invited the police to restore order, and in the process, the security men were reported to have shot four of the students.

One of the students, simply identified as Ibukun, said “our first semester exam was supposed to start on Monday and those still owing school fees were not allowed to write the exams, but they did not leave the school premises.

They protested that they be allowed to write the exams. “This continued and some students started throwing stones at the buildings. This did not go down well with the Provost who called in the police to restore order.

But since they could not control the situation, the policemen had to fire gunshots, even as the bullets hit four of our students, killing three of them while one of them survived.

Another male student who collaborated Ibukun’s account, said, “We had started writing the exams when we heard sounds of broken bottles and saw that stones were being thrown at our building. All of us had to rush out to see what was happening.

“There was pandemonium when we got outside for the next thirty minutes before normalcy was restored. Surprisingly, when I was going to the auditorium, I saw the police coming into the school compound. From that moment till the time we ran away, it was like a war situation. Later, we discovered that four of our colleagues had been shot and only one of them survived”, he said.

They attacked the areas with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and petrol-bombs, torching many houses and carting away food items and livestock.

Though details of the exact number of people and houses destroyed in the multiple attacks are sketchy, an anonymous community leader of Kunde, said that 15 people were killed by the armed terrorists, when they overran six other communities of Gathahure, Hwa'a, Tihezeh, Hrazah, Hembe and Gjigga on the Mandara Hills, that stretch for 16 kilometres, east of Gwoza, the council headquarters.

This came as members of the Joint Task Force (JTF) smashed a Boko Haram hideout in Fune Local Council of Yobe State and recovered arms and ammunition used by the sect.

A picture taken from a video distributed to journalists in recent days through intermediaries and obtained by AFP on March 5, 2013 reportedly shows Abubakar Shekau (C), the suspected leader of Nigerian Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, flanked by six armed and hooded fighters in an undisclosed place.

Meanwhile, youths popularly called Civilian JTF invaded Sulimanti Ward, a suburb of Maiduguri Metropolis in a search of a Boko Haram chief killer.

The Kunde community leader said residents of Kunde and the six others fled to Gwoza town, Barawa, Agaplawa, Kurana Bassa, Kwatara, Limankara and Ngoshe Ndahang.

The other communities ransacked by the terrorists, he said, include border towns of the Republic of Cameroon, where some of the residents had fled with their wives and children.

Confirming the incident yesterday in Maiduguri, a top military source of the Special Operations Forces (MISOF) at Barawa, a border village said: ""some of the villages on Gwoza Hills cannot be accessed by our men because of the difficult terrain. Our men can only be stationed at this village for our operations with fighter jets that could bombard the hills with cannons to destroy the training camps and hideouts of Boko Haram sect members.""

On casualties of the attacks, he said that one of the community leaders reported to the Divisional Police Officer of Gwoza that 15 people were killed by the terrorists.

Due to the total closure of GSM network services in Borno State for the past one month, the JTF Spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa and the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Gideon Jubrin could not be reached for comments.

JTF Recover arms in Yobe

Twenty - four hours after attacking a JTF post at Potiskum in Yobe State, soldiers smashed a Boko Haram hideout and recovered of arms and ammunition, including police jacket and helmets; after they had attacked another post in Fune Local Government Area of the State on Friday night.

The house is situated in the New GRA area of Maiduguri metropolis. This is even as security operatives prevented the multi-billion naira home of the former governor of the state, Ali Modu Sherrif, from being razed as they stopped the rampaging youths, who were already advancing towards the house within the same GRA.

National Mirror learnt that Othman, who was at home prior to the incident, narrowly escaped death as he was whisked away in a Toyota Camry saloon car before the angry youths arrived.

An eyewitness, Mr. Mohammed Bukar Gana, said: “We were in a taxi, driving along the Lagos Street to the University of Maiduguri. When we reached the NUJ/ GRA junction, all roads were blocked by the Civilian JTF. “We spent more than 50 minutes inside the hold-up before we saw smoke coming out from the direction of the ANPP chairman’s residence.”

Our correspondent saw some of the Civilian JTF members chanting in Hausa, “Mun kona gidan Mala Othman sora na Ali Sheriff don suna cikin masu taimaka ma yanta’ada”, meaning: we have burnt the residence of Mala Othman, we are now going to Ali Sheriff’s house and do the same because both are among the sponsors of terrorism in the state. Another eyewitness, Mallam Musa Kaigama, said: “We were trapped in a holdup along the busy Lagos Street for over an hour.

We saw many Civilian JTF advancing towards the Lagos House road, leading to Ali Sheriff’s house. “In fact, they were chanting songs, saying we have burnt the residence of Mala Othman, it remains that of Ali Modu Sheriff. “Later, we started hearing gunshots from the area, which scared the youths and prevented them from torching the house of the former governor.”

Security operatives guarding Sheriff’s house shot sporadically into the air to disperse the youths when they attempted to raze the house.

The youths have been commended by Governor Kashim Shettima and other individuals for their efforts that had led to the arrest of many Boko Haram sect members in Maiduguri and Damaturu, the Yobe State capital. They had vowed to arrest the ANPP state chairman and Sheriff and hand them over to security agencies for appropriate action.

National Mirror last week authoritatively reported that some of the youths had gone to the residence of the ANPP chairman with the intention of arresting him but security operatives guarding the residence begged the aggrieved youths not to carry out their mission as Othman had travelled to Abuja. A reliable source told our correspondent that the ANPP chairman had been on the run when security reports indicted him of possessing firearms in his house.

The source said: “This is not the first time Mala Othman has been on the run for his alleged possession and supply of arms and ammunition to terrorists.

“In fact, during that period, Othman had to flee from the state to unknown destination for almost eight months to avoid being arrested.” One of the youths said: “We knew most of the members of Boko Haram sect and their families.

We have vowed to ensure that Othman and Sherriff will never escape arrest as we have evidence that they have been supplying firearms to terrorists in the state.”

In a related development, a middle-aged woman suspected to be member of the sect, who attempted to plant an improvised explosive device, IED, in Baga Road market square of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, was critically injured as the bomb detonated before she reached her target on Sunday. This is even as the Civilian JTF arrested two women with AK 47rifles at Monday Market of the metropolis.

An eyewitness, Abubakar Kundiri, living about 300 metres away from site of the incident said: “ We were sitting under this tree with two of my friends when the woman came and passed by carrying something in her bag that looked like a tin of cowbell milk and when she got to a place, she bent over and put the thing she was carrying on the ground. “No sooner had she stood up than we heard a loud sound and she was blown off.

“In fact we are very lucky to be alive as we never knew she was carrying a deadly explosive device, which could have exploded here and killed all of us.”

Our correspondent also gathered that hundreds of people, who heard the sound of the blast trooped to the site to glance at the mangled body of the woman before security operatives removed the body."

An eyewitness, Mr. Mohammed Bukar Gana, said: “We were in a taxi, driving along the Lagos Street to the University of Maiduguri. When we reached the NUJ/ GRA junction, all roads were blocked by the Civilian JTF. “We spent more than 50 minutes inside the hold-up before we saw smoke coming out from the direction of the ANPP chairman’s residence.”

Our correspondent saw some of the Civilian JTF members chanting in Hausa, “Mun kona gidan Mala Othman sora na Ali Sheriff don suna cikin masu taimaka ma yanta’ada”, meaning: we have burnt the residence of Mala Othman, we are now going to Ali Sheriff’s house and do the same because both are among the sponsors of terrorism in the state. Another eyewitness, Mallam Musa Kaigama, said: “We were trapped in a holdup along the busy Lagos Street for over an hour.

We saw many Civilian JTF advancing towards the Lagos House road, leading to Ali Sheriff’s house. “In fact, they were chanting songs, saying we have burnt the residence of Mala Othman, it remains that of Ali Modu Sheriff. “Later, we started hearing gunshots from the area, which scared the youths and prevented them from torching the house of the former governor.”

Security operatives guarding Sheriff’s house shot sporadically into the air to disperse the youths when they attempted to raze the house.

The youths have been commended by Governor Kashim Shettima and other individuals for their efforts that had led to the arrest of many Boko Haram sect members in Maiduguri and Damaturu, the Yobe State capital. They had vowed to arrest the ANPP state chairman and Sheriff and hand them over to security agencies for appropriate action.

National Mirror last week authoritatively reported that some of the youths had gone to the residence of the ANPP chairman with the intention of arresting him but security operatives guarding the residence begged the aggrieved youths not to carry out their mission as Othman had travelled to Abuja. A reliable source told our correspondent that the ANPP chairman had been on the run when security reports indicted him of possessing firearms in his house.

The source said: “This is not the first time Mala Othman has been on the run for his alleged possession and supply of arms and ammunition to terrorists.

“In fact, during that period, Othman had to flee from the state to unknown destination for almost eight months to avoid being arrested.” One of the youths said: “We knew most of the members of Boko Haram sect and their families.

We have vowed to ensure that Othman and Sherriff will never escape arrest as we have evidence that they have been supplying firearms to terrorists in the state.”

In a related development, a middle-aged woman suspected to be member of the sect, who attempted to plant an improvised explosive device, IED, in Baga Road market square of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, was critically injured as the bomb detonated before she reached her target on Sunday. This is even as the Civilian JTF arrested two women with AK 47rifles at Monday Market of the metropolis.

An eyewitness, Abubakar Kundiri, living about 300 metres away from site of the incident said: “ We were sitting under this tree with two of my friends when the woman came and passed by carrying something in her bag that looked like a tin of cowbell milk and when she got to a place, she bent over and put the thing she was carrying on the ground. “No sooner had she stood up than we heard a loud sound and she was blown off.

“In fact we are very lucky to be alive as we never knew she was carrying a deadly explosive device, which could have exploded here and killed all of us.”

Our correspondent also gathered that hundreds of people, who heard the sound of the blast trooped to the site to glance at the mangled body of the woman before security operatives removed the body."

The House of Representatives, yesterday passed a motion urging the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mr. Muhammed Abubakar and military authorities to investigate the killing of ten traders by the Boko Haram insurgents in Borno State.

The traders, from Ibadan in Oyo State were killed two weeks ago, when their vehicle was attacked while on their way to buy goods in the troubled state.

The House also asked the security agencies to ensure that the culprits were apprehended and brought to justice to deter others who might be planning to join the insurgents.

The House also urged the Federal Government to improve on the security situation in Borno State, especially in public places like market and places of worship.

Moreover, the House called on the Federal Government to compile a comprehensive list of Boko Haram victims, with a view to compensating their families.

The resolutions were sequel to a motion moved by Hon. Ajibola Muraina (PDP-Oyo), which was unanimously adopted by the lawmakers when put to vote by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, who presided over the session.

Moving the motion, titled: “Gruesome killing of Ibadan traders in Borno State by members of Boko Haram”, Muraina narrated how the 10 the traders were killed by persons believed to be members of the sect, while several millions of Naira were stolen from them.

The lawmaker expressed concern that the brutal attack occurred irrespective of the emergency rule existing in the state. He further expressed concern that there were no adequate measures in place to safeguard lives and property of citizens in the affected state.

The lawmaker called for an increase in security presence in Borno and other states under emergency rule. The motion was unanimously adopted by the House.

Meanwhile, the Defence Headquarters, DHQ, yesterday in Abuja restored GSM services to Adamawa State in deference to calls by stakeholders for the restoration of telephone services in the three northeastern states, where emergency declaration was declared."

Witnesses said over 20 men, clad in Hijab (flowing cloth and veil, popular among Muslim women) and Abaya (a long rob also popular among women in Borno) were arrested around the Police station.

A security source said the incident happened around 2pm, adding that all the suspects had AK47 Rifles and Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs) concealed in beneath their cloth.

The source said the attempted attack was repelled because a combine team of soldiers, policemen and SSS were keeping watch at the station which is directly facing the Baga Market.

Besides, there was serious fight at Jajeri area of Maiduguri yesterday when suspected Boko Haram members detonated an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in order to scare away dozens of youth of the vigilante groups, popularly known as 'Civilian JTF' who stormed the area in order to rid it of insurgents.

Witnesses said the sound of the blast which rattled the people in nearby settlements as well as the sporadic gunshots by the insurgents did not deter the surging youth from advancing into the area seen as ""safe abode"" for suspected Boko Haram members in the last four years.

Sabiu Buba, a technician along Baga road said trouble started around 1.15pm when the youth, carrying daggers, sticks and ropes mobilized themselves and moved into the area.

""while many traders at the Baga market and shop owners on the highway were scampering for safety, the volunteer youths were not deterred, they only took cover for a while and thereafter stormed the red spot,"" Buba said.

Helen Musa, a food vendor told our correspondent that she saw when operatives of the Joint Task Force, (JTF) lent a helping hand to the ""civilian JTF.""

Soon after the incident, the ""civilian JTF"" took over the Baga Road and carried out stop and search operation.

A top security source confirmed that there was blast at Jajeri but neither the vigilante members nor any security personnel was injured.

He described the turn of events in Maiduguri as 'fruitful and rewarding' adding that military personnel are giving the youth groups sense of direction in order to reduce risk."

Items recovered from the robbers

| credits: File copy

Five of the gunmen who stormed the 04 Hotel in Ajah area of Lagos last Sunday have been confirmed dead.

The robbers were killed in the early hours of Sunday (yesterday) in a shoot-out with the Special Anti Robbery Squad Ikeja, Lagos.

Several gunmen had stormed the hotel in a purported reprisal for the arrest of a colleague by SARS operatives at the same hotel. Seven persons including the owner of the hotel, Olarenwaju Subair, were killed in the attack.

Police sources who craved anonymity, told PUNCH Metro that the robbers who were moving in a convoy of an Honda Odyssey and a Jeep on Sunday (yesterday) for another operation, had earlier attacked some policemen at Ajah and later at Ajao Estate before the shoot-out with SARS operatives.

A police source said, “The robbers began their operation around 1am at Ajah but just as they were moving out, they encountered a team of policemen on routine patrol. They opened fire on them and in the ensuing exchange of fire, one policeman was killed in the process and another wounded.

“Immediately, the robbers aborted their mission and drove drown to Ajao Estate. They got to Ajao Estate at about 2am and attacked a major dealer in phones, ipads and other ICT products.

“In the process, a police corporal, attached to the Mobile Police Force was killed. Valuables worth millions of naira were carted away.”

Having received a directive from the Lagos Commissioner of Police, Mr. Umar Manko, to apprehend the robbers, SARS operatives led by their leader, SP Abba Kyari, were said to have laid ambush along the Mushin/Ojuelegba areas while two more teams went towards the island to block the robbers escape.

Not long after, the robbers who eventually drove through the Mushin/Ojuelegba road, were said to have opened fire on sighting the SARS teams.

In an intense gunfight that reportedly lasted 30 minutes, the robbers were chased from Stadium in Surulere to Eko Bridge.

The source said, “Some of the robbers had been wounded in the car from the gunfight but that didn’t stop them from driving. It wasn’t until the driver of one of their vehicles sustained a gunshot injury to the neck that the vehicles stopped at Eko Bridge.

“Some were already dead in the car. Several more fled their vehicles and jumped over the Eko Bridge into the ocean below. But some of those who jumped must have been wounded, because there was blood on the rails of the bridge.”

It was learnt that items from Ajao estate were recovered from the vehicles of the robbers. Policemen from the Area A command and the Marine Police later combed the waters, but did not find any corpse.

Manko confirmed the incident to PUNCH Metro.

He said, “Five robbers were killed in the exchange of gunfire with SARS operatives. They had earlier attacked a major phone dealer at Ajao Estate before they were ambushed by SARS operatives along the Mushin/Ojuelegba areas.”"

The police in Gombe State have confirmed the killing of two of its men on Sunday night by gunmen during an attack at a filling station in the state capital.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Fwaje Atajiri, confirmed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Monday in Gombe.

He said the gunmen attacked the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation mega filling station on the Gombe-Biu road at 7.20pm with the intention of robbing the station, but failed.

He said the two policemen were killed by the robbers while some members of the gang escaped with bullet wounds.

He said the police were investigating the incident with a view to finding out where the wounded robbers were being treated.

Meanwhile, A former Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Yemi Osibajo, SAN, has identified government neglect as the main cause of Boko Haram.

He stated this in Lagos at a press briefing to mark the presentation of a book, It’s a journey by Bemigho Omayuku.

The legal icons, who noted that there was hope for Nigeria despite the prevailing insecurity, stressed the need for the government at all levels to fulfil its promises.

Osibajo said, “The reason we look up to 2015 is because we have hope. We know that God is able to do all things. When we, as a nation canvass for a change, I believe that change will come.

“Boko Haram is a measure of the helplessness of some. The reason anyone will consciously want to kill themselves is because they have lost hope and the reason they (or some) have lost hope is because government has not taken to its promises of providing for the poor and the vulnerable.”"

The clash, our correspondent gathered, occurred when MASSOB members went to a bush camp off the Onitsha-Owerri Expressway to dislodge AIYO operatives.

The MASSOB’s Director of Information, Mr. Uchenna Madu, who spoke on the clash, said his group was reacting to complaints from members of the public about the criminal activities of AIYO members.

Madu said MASSOB got complaints that AIYO operatives were using their camps along Onitsha-Owerri road to torture people.

He said, “MASSOB as the genuine Igbo group genuinely fighting for Ndigbo after bad reports of rape, kidnapping, illegal arrest and detention and armed robberies by a group of miscreants that called themselves AIYO decided to move into their illegal camps where even security agents could not enter. I am talking to you, we have taken over the area and dislodged them.

“On many occasions, they had kidnapped people including our men, took them to these illegal torture camps where the victims were forced to part with money and other valuables to regain their freedom.”

However, a leader of AIYO, who craved anonymity, said members of MASSOB invaded their camp wielding dangerous weapons and tried to dislodge them.

The AIYO leader accused MASSOB members of committing atrocities against residents of Onitsha by continually extorting money from them and sponsoring criminal activities.

Meanwhile, the Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Emeka Chukwuemeka, confirmed the incident but said nobody died in the clash."

Confusion enveloped the Peoples Democratic Party secretariat in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, on Tuesday when gunmen invaded the premises, attacking party leaders and journalists, who came for a briefing.

The hoodlums, who fired several gunshots into the air, took control of the secretariat for over an hour.

During the attack, a former Speaker of the state House of Assembly and member of the party’s Consensus Screening Committee, Mr. Kola Adefemi, had his head broken.

The politician, who our correspondent gathered fainted due to the attack, was later revived at an undisclosed hospital.

The state chairman of Correspondent Chapel of Nigeria Union of Journalists, Mr. Rotimi Ojomoyela, and Dayo Oladele, a New Nigeria Newspapers correspondent, among many others also sustained serious injuries during the attack.

The briefing was reportedly organised by some party leaders to announce the suspension of the state PDP chairman, Mr. Makanjuola Ogundipe, and to reject the constitution of the CSC.

The party’s Deputy Chairman, Mr. Femi Bamisile; Secretary, Dr. Tope Aluko; and the Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Oluwawole, were among eminent politicians from the state that had converged on the secretariat before the hoodlums invaded the premises.

Meanwhile, members of the state working committee of the party, including Oluwawole, Women Leader, Mrs. Busola Oyebode; Mr. Femi Ogunleye; Alhaji Lateef Agbaje; Secretary, Tope Aluko, and Treasurer, A.O. Aluko, had signed a statement announcing the rejection of the CSC.

The statement read, “The current situation in the management of the affairs of the party, calls for caution if the party will win the 2014 elections. We, the undersigned, wish to dissociate ourselves from the purported list of the Consensus Screening Committee.”

In a related development, Oluwawole announced the suspension of the party chairman for one month.

He alleged that the party chairman single-handedly constituted the CSC without the approval of the SWC.

He said, “The purported composition of Consensus Screening Committee, headed by our most revered Justice Edward Ojuolape, is nothing but a creation of the chairman, Chief Makanjuola Ogundipe, without the support of the two-third majority of the state Working Committee.”

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Victor Babayemi, who said no one was arrested following the violence, added that policemen were deployed in the secretariat to prevent a breakdown of law and order."

The discovery of the kidnappers’ den followed the kidnap of the wife of the deputy leader of Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Mrs. Winifred Ogbu last Friday by a six-member kidnap gang that operated with motorcycles in Abakaliki.

The Anambra State police command yesterday recorded another success in its fight against crime as it arrested 17 suspected armed robbers and recovered not fewer than 10 arms and thousands of ammunition. Addressing journalists, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Emeka Chukwuemeka said the suspects were arrested in various parts of the state.

Chukwuemeka said the suspects, including one 16-year-old Ifeanyi, who specialized in bank robbery and blocking of major roads, were arrested by men of the state Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS), for allegedly committing crimes in the state.

It was gathered that one of the suspects, whose lifeless body was also paraded, allegedly killed a 55-year-old man .

The PPRO further disclosed that the four-man gang of armed robbers, arrested by SARS operatives, specialized in planting beautiful girls in banks, who in turn give information to the suspects on customers’ withdrawals.

He said the suspects were responsible for armed robberies at major roads of Abba and other parts of the state, adding that they were also responsible for killings and raping of innocent citizens in the state.

Chukwuemeka displayed a teddy bear and a small television set allegedly used to conceal pistols and ammunition by the suspects, saying that SARS operatives had been on the trail of the suspects until recently when they were arrested.

“For anybody that sees this television and the teddy bear, they are for this gang. What they do is to rip open the teddy bear, conceal pistol and ammunition in it and enter vehicles, you will not know they have a gun until they rob you.”

They invented this style to escape from the police and other security agencies but our men were able to beat them in their own game,” he said.

Items allegedly recovered from the suspects included AK 47 rifles,three Pump Action rifles, four English and three locally made pistols and thousands of ammunitions, set of television set and a teddy allegedly used by the suspects to conceal arms.

One of the suspects, 16-year-old Ifeanyi confessed to the crime and said he was involved in planting young girls in banks in the commercial city of Onitsha to give them information concerning withdrawals in each bank.

He said: “I was a student in a secondary school in Onitsha. I dropped out in JSS 1 and because my parents could not train me in school, I met a friend of mine that introduced me into this deal. We have carried out many robberies in Onitsha and its environs.”"

This was as about 50 other suspected terrorists were arrested in the state.

The three suspects came all the way from Bama Local Government and invaded the El-Amin Daggash mosque in the Government Reserved Area, GRA, in Maiduguri, during Tafsir (Ramadan preaching), attempting to kill the preacher, Modu Mustapha.

One of the suspects was killed on the spot, while the remaining two, who were initially arrested, were also lynched later.

It was gathered that the terrorists came in a Golf saloon car and one tricycle armed with AK47 rifles and a pistol.

A source said the incident happened about 4pm, when the Tafsir programme was going on.

The source added that somebody first sighted one of the terrorists with a pistol sitting comfortably among the congregation and raised the alarm.

He added that immediately the suspect was apprehended, the people around pounced on him and beat him to death.

The other two suspects, who were also inside the mosque, were arrested while attempting to escape and were killed a few metres away from the mosque.

However, the Joint Task Force, JTF, Operation Restore Order in Borno State capital, said there was no attempted attack on any worship centre in the state.

The JTF noted that it was an error of judgement by a policeman on duty that pursued someone who allegedly stole a Keke NAPEP and a bag of rice and drove off towards the said mosque.

Its spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, said in a statement that: “The JTF wishes to clear the air on what happened at the vicinity of El-Amin Daggash mosque in GRA, Maiduguri on Saturday 20th July, 2013.

“The incident was not a terrorist attack as insinuated, rather, it was an error of judgement by a policeman on duty that pursued someone who allegedly stole a tricycle and a bag of rice and drove off.

“The policeman was in mufti, wore Nigeria Police Force, NPF, reflective jacket, pursued the alleged thief and fired two gunshots.”

Musa said the incident happened very close to the said mosque when Ramadan preaching was on, adding that the firing by the policeman attracted the attention of worshippers, including youths popularly known as ‘Civilian JTF,’ that were within and around the mosque.

He said: “As a result, there was pandemonium that led to the death of one minor while three others sustained injuries.”

The spokesman noted that the vigilantes beat the policeman, burnt the Toyota Carina saloon car, which the policeman was driving and the tricycle, before the JTF patrol team rescued the policeman, calmed the youths and restored normalcy to the area.

In another development, over 50 suspected terrorists were over the weekend arrested in Maduganari ward area of Maiduguri with the assistance of ‘Civilian JTF’ and men of the JTF."

Peace committee on Boko Haram a huge scam, says Huriwa

NEMESIS caught up with some unknown gunmen who invaded a village near Fadan Kaje in Zango Kataf local council of Kaduna State, as they were overpowered by hundreds of villagers, who killed two of them, while the rest fled.

The gunmen were said to have arrived at Madauchi village at about 1a.m Sunday and invaded the residence of a prominent villager with the intention of stealing cows.

According to sources, there were sporadic gunshots from the gunmen, which attracted people from other villages, who came out in large number, engaged them in a shootout and killed two. The Kaduna State Police Command spokesman, DSP Aminu Lawal, confirmed the incident Sunday.

Nevertheless, an “error of judgment” saw the Borno State Vigilance Youth Group (BVYG) attack a policeman (name withheld) near El-Amin Daggash Mosque in Maiduguri as he was attempting to capture someone who allegedly stole a bag of rice and a tricycle over the weekend.

Meanwhile, the non-governmental Human Rights Writers’ Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) yesterday called on President Goodluck Jonathan to immediately disband the Presidential Special Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of the Security Challenges in the North, headed by the Minister of Special Duties, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (SAN).

In a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, HURIWA said it would amount to grave disservice to the public for the committee to continue to exist after President Jonathan had refuted Turaki’s claim that Boko Haram had signed a ceasefire effect from the commencement of Ramadan.

Spokesman of the Joint Task Force (JTF), Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, said in a statement that, “it was an error of judgment by a policeman on duty, who pursued someone who allegedly stole a tricycle and a bag of rice and drove off. The policeman, who was in mufti, wore NPF reflective jacket, pursued the alleged thief and fired two shots.”

In the following melee, a minor was also killed near the mosque, while three others were injured before the intervention of the JTF. The firing by the policeman was said to have attracted the worshippers, including the vigilance youth, who were within and around the mosque.

Musa explained that, ‘the vigilantes lynched the policeman, burnt the Toyota Carina (that the policeman was in) and the tricycle,” while the JTF rescued and took the policeman away after restoring order.

In another development still at the weekend in Zajeri and Madaganari wards of Maiduguri, the combined efforts of the Joint Task Force (JTF) and members of Borno Vigilance Youth Group (BVYG) saw the arrest of six suspected Boko Haram terrorists during a dawn raid.

The three arrested suspects in Madaganari, according to an eyewitness, were picked up at a hideout by the vigilance group, who also recovered three guns, and later handed them over to the JTF sector commander, who coordinated the dawn raid.

The other three suspects, he disclosed, were arrested in Zajeri ward when the suspects dressed in female attires and hid two rifles in their veils. A resident of Zajeri also told The Guardian that the arrested suspects were attempting to flee the area before their arrest.

Speaking on the incidents, Chairman of BVYG, Abubakar Mallum, said the arrests followed an intelligence report on fleeing members of the Islamist sect to Madaganari on Friday after the Jumat prayers.

The youths, he added, alerted the JTF, and the soldiers reinforced their patrol teams, who condoned the entire ward before the terror suspects were picked up and handed over to the sector JTF commander. Col. Musa also confirmed the arrests yesterday, noting that it followed a successful dawn raid in Maiduguri.

HURIWA described the exercise as a “huge scam and a scandalous contraption that ought not to have been set up in the first place,” and demanded that members of the committee should return to the public coffers all expenses incurred so far in their “merry-go-round.”

More so, the group said, “the claim of ceasefire was within 48 hours repudiated by the leader of the dreaded armed Islamic rebels, Sheikh Abubakar Shekau, who claimed in a 10-minute video recording that it has no subsisting peace talk with the Nigerian Government.”

That was besides President Jonathan’s interview with the United States’ Cable News Network, where he told the world that the country had no ceasefire talk with the group."

This is the second time the youths would burn a suspected member of the Boko Haram in less than a week.

Some of the vigilante members who took part in the burning said the suspect had once killed and burned a soldier in the area sometime last year.

The claim could not be verified from the spokesman of the Joint Task Force, JTF, Lt Col Sagir Musa but a security source confirmed that the youths had burnt the suspect.

""This (the action of the vigilantes) is a serious source of concern to us... jungle justice is a crime in itself and we want parents to caution their wards against it,"" the source said.

Weekly Trust gathered that the suspected Boko Haram member had led insurgents in the killing of many people and perpetrated ""many atrocities"" at Gwange Sabon Layi.

""The actions of the suspect who fled to the forest last December prompted soldiers to sack residents from the area,"" a resident of Gwange said.

One of the vigilantes also corroborated. ""Only Allah knows how eager we were to catch that guy (burnt suspect) alive. As a result of his bad deeds, soldiers sacked and closed our area completely. But we were then told that the guy had escaped into the forest. Some even believed that he has been killed since. We were on operations when we saw him.

""On seeing him, all the youths shouted 'here he is'. Then everyone of us was jubilating, seeing our 'wanted guy'.

""So, we instantly reminded him of what he did last year, but to our surprise, he started begging us to pardon him. As he was crying, we tied him up, poured fuel on his body and set him on fire. No pity for Boko Haram sect members at all now. Thousands have been displaced and hundreds were killed because of his bad deeds,"" the vigilante said."

The incident occurred on Tuesday after a twohour house-to-house search by a combined team of soldiers and youths.

A witness, who preferred anonymity, said some patriotic Nigerians helped the team to identify the suspects

. He said: “Our village head permitted the vigilance youths and soldiers to go ahead with the manhunt for fleeing sect members in this village, as they had killed several villagers.

“Each time the soldiers round up and arrest the suspects in Damboa town, some of them would flee to this village and take refuge among us, before the youths yesterday (Tuesday) fished out about 23 or more of Boko Haram members in this village.”

The witness said one prominent politician in the village also assisted the youths in identifying the suspects.

According to him, the youths and the JTF men recovered some rifles, which the terrorists used in attacking people in Damboa, Chibok and three other villages, south of Sambisa Games Reserve Forest of southern Borno Senatorial District.

Speaking on the houseto- house search, the village head (names withheld) said: “The youths are doing a good job to save our people’s lives and property.

“When Damboa was attacked in April with the killing of 18 vigilance group members for allegedly buying pork meat and other bush meat in the market, some of the gunmen fled to this village without being arrested by either the JTF or the police, until today (Tuesday).

“These youths from Maiduguri assisted me and my people and protected us during the twohour operation carried out here.”

He said the vigilance youths were able to fish out 23 Boko Haram members from the village, along with some of their motorcycles, used in launching attacks on villages, schools and motorists on the Maiduguri – Damboa Road.

The JTF spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, and the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Gideon Jubrin, could not be reached to confirm the story because of the total closure of GSM services in Borno State in the last two months."

From GEOFFREY ANYANWU, Awka

Hail was let loose Wednesday evening, in Awka, the capital city of Anambra State, as members of the Awka Catholic Diocese and natives of Umudioka village, Awka, had a bloody clash over dust-to-dust burial rites. In the clash, over 30 persons were seriously injured while about four vehicles were damaged.

Though some of the victims of the bloody clash have been discharged from the hospital, about eight, including a 70-year-old man, were still lying critically at the Regina Caeli Hospital, Awka, as at press time yesterday.

The clash, which was said to have taken place between 4.30pm and 7pm, caused pandemonium in the area, as various dangerous weapons, including machetes, were freely used, forcing residents of the area to run for their dear lives.

While the Catholic Church claimed that her members were attacked by the Umudioka youths, as they where coming back from Mass at the family of the late Mr. Samuel Nwanna Nnebolise in Umudioka, the villagers said they were attacked by thugs brought by the Catholic Church over their insistence on their burial customs and tradition.

It could be recalled that there has been a feud between the Catholic Church and the Awka community over the dust-to-dust burial rite, which escalated on May 23, 2013 during the planed burial of the late Nnebolise, when the youth of Umudioka allegedly disrupted the burial and desecrated holy things.

At the hospital yesterday, some of the victims, who could speak, alleged that they were ambushed by Umudioka youths, on their way home from the Nnebolise family, after the prayers.

Nurses said they battled all night to save the lives of the victims, especially, 19-year-old Moses Ogah from St. John’s Church Umuokpu, whose throat was almost chopped off and 23-year-old Aduaka Jonah Ekene, from St. Martins Church Abagan, who had severe machete cuts all around his body.

Narrating his ordeal to Daily Sun on his hospital bed, 70-year-old, Sir Peter C. Offodile, a knight of St. Molumba said: “Someone sent me a text yesterday that the Bishop wanted to address us by 2pm.

I came and they said that we should go and pray for the family of Nnebolise and everybody should march to the place for the celebration of Mass. All of us, including priests, indeed, about 50 of them, we went there and celebrated Mass and sermon was said and communion served.

“After the Mass, we all marched through Majoua Street on our way home. A group of boys from Umudioka stopped us and started attacking us with sticks and stones. They pushed me into the gutter.

One of the boys broke my hand with a big stick and some used their machetes to hit me. I managed to get out of the gutter almost naked, holding my trousers; I even lost one pair of my shoe. It was at the end of the road that we saw the police.

From there we were taken to the Cathedral and then to the hospital, Regina Caeli, where I am being treated.”

Another victim, Sir Obuekwe Obikwelu from Umuanaga village Awka, whose head was bandaged because of the machete cuts he got said: “We went to celebrate Mass at Umudioka at late Nnebolise’s family and after celebrating the mass, we were coming back when we were waylaid by some bad boys.

As we were running I looked back and saw an old man my fellow knight of St. Molumba being beating by the boys and I felt if I left him, they may kill the old man. I went to them and said this person you are beating is an old man and your brother; why beat him?

They turned round and swooped on me, the first one gave me a machete cut here, as I was holding the side, stones were rained on me and I was rushed to this hospital.” The Cathedral Administrator, St. Patrick Cathedral Awka, Rev. Fr. Patrick Amaobi Chukwuma, who has been at the centre of the matter, told Daily Sun at the hospital that they went to Nnebolise family to pray for them only to be attacked again by the Umudioka youths.

He said: “Yesterday some priests from Awka Diocese, from Awka region and Adazi region and some laity, including Catholic men, Catholic women and some youths we went to identify with poor family of Nnebolise, who have been suppressed by some people from Umudioka because they are poor.

This thing has been happening since May 24, when their father, Samuel Nnebolise, died.

The man before he died willed that he will be buried according to Catholic rite but the villagers said no, he would be buried according to traditional rite that is the controversy.

“But the family invited us to bury their father, according Catholic rite, which they refused and the corpse was returned to the mortuary and the family went into prayers.

Last week, they wanted to stage a prayer and after putting canopies and chairs for the prayers, the same youths masked themselves, with about 20 masquerades; that was last Monday.

They came into the family, armed and destroyed the canopies, took away the seats, snatched handsets, destroyed the altar set and carried everything away with some clothes.

“Yesterday, the church organised herself to celebrate Mass with the family. We went there with many priests and laity.

After celebrating the Mass, we were about to go when stones started flying from hidden places, from uncompleted houses, some houses. Stones were being thrown by unknown people. Our youths have to defend the members of the church.

They threw back the stones. We were going, not knowing that the Umudioka youths were armed with machetes and they started stabbing people. You have seen some of the victims.

They were about 36, who sustained injuries from machete cuts and stones. About 36 of them were affected. Some have been discharged. Those who are critical are still in the hospital.” Disagreeing with Rev. Fr. Chukwuma’s account, the Chairman, Okolobia Umudioka, Chief Ejike Nwude, said the church members attacked the village.

He said: “It’s unfortunate, the mayhem was caused by the thugs. They waylaid us yesterday, beat up our boys, destroyed our houses, even vehicles. Yesterday morning we went to the Area Command with Father Chukwuma for peace, and the Area Commander instructed everybody to be at peace and not to go to Umudioka again.

“We accepted what the commander said and left, everybody went home and that was why they took us unaware because we were not expecting them.

We thought we’ve reached a point of agreement. Unfortunately, around 4pm, I started getting phone calls that the Catholic priest, with heavily armed people, marched from St Patrick through Majua and when they got to Majua Street, they started breaking glasses of Umudioka buildings, throwing stone, singing war songs and making abusive insinuations.

“In the process, one Igbogi Ejikeme, unaware that they were coming for war, ran into them and they pounced on him. The young man is still in the hospital as I am speaking with you.

While they were going, they saw Chukeudeme’s house and they destroyed it. “They started throwing stones on anybody they met on the way. We ran away.

We could not do anything because we were not expecting such magnitude of thugs.” On who injured the church people, Nwude said: “Because they came from different places. They did not know themselves.

They attacked themselves, because immediately you step out of the land and tried to come back they take you as an enemy. They inflicted the injuries on themselves because they came from different places.

They were hired. Some came from Nise, Mbaukwu and Nanka and so on.”"

In the violence on Friday and Saturday, 23 people were killed in Mainok and 20 in Dawashi when the sect's gunmen launched reprisals against the so-called Civilian JTF group, which is hunting for insurgents.

Many more people were also injured, some of them with life-threatening gunshot wounds.

The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) based in Kukawa confirmed the deaths in Dawashi, saying the incident happened when Boko Haram gunmen opened fire on vigilantes who stormed the village in search of insurgents.""According to an eyewitness who pleaded anonymity, a group of Civilian Joint Task Force from Maiduguri stormed the village Dawashi in search of Boko Haram members when the suspected sect members came armed and fired sporadic shots that killed over twenty innocent civilians while a dozen secured serious gunshot injury,"" MNJTF spokesman Lt. Haruna Sani said in a statement emailed to journalists yesterday.

""The victims are mostly fishermen and traders who pursue their legitimate business in the area. As at the time of compiling this report, the (surviving) victims were still lying within the premises of MNJTF Field Ambulance receiving medical treatment from the injury sustained during the attack.

""Meanwhile, heavily armed Quick Reaction Group from MNJTF had been deployed to ensure the safety of lives and property in the area. The general area of Dawashi, Daban Masara and Malan Karanti are known to be suspected Boko Haram infested areas.""

Earlier on Friday, members of Volunteer Vigilante Youth Group also known as 'Civilian JTF' went to Mainok, 58 kilometers from Maiduguri, where they arrested some insurgents but were ambushed on their way back to the state capital.

One of the vigilantes died on the spot while three others died at the Umaru Shehu Hospital in Maiduguri. Many others have been admitted to receive treatment, leader of the vigilante Abubakar Malum said.

But soon after the vigilantes were ambushed, the attackers suspected to be Boko Haram fighters moved to Mainok, where they took advantage of the night to wreak havoc, locals said.

They said many people were killed because the incident happened shortly after the village market closed.

""Minutes after we held activities at the market, we began sighting some people coming out from the forests on motorcycles. When they approached us, we realised that they were gunmen and as soon as they arrived, they just started shooting indiscriminately,"" said villager Malim Gana who fled to Maiduguri.

""They shot dead many people at the market, proceeded to the town and slaughtered 20 old men and then blocked the highway and set ablaze three other persons in their car heading to Maiduguri.""

Residents said the mayhem in Mainok was a reprisal by the Boko Haram members who accused the villagers of rising against them by establishing vigilante groups and liaising with youths coming from Maiduguri to track down insurgents."

The Lagos State Police Command has commenced investigations into the killing of a police corporal, Ado Ayuba, who was lynched by some hoodlums in Suru Alaba area of the state.

According to the police, the victim was beaten to death by an irate mob for allegedly killing a trader, Mustapha Mohammed, on July 30, 2013.

PUNCH Metro learnt that Ayuba and another policeman were deployed to the scene to chase away traders who had illegally taken over a portion of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.

It was learnt that trading activities by the traders usually caused gridlock in the area. It was also learnt that some residents and motorists had complained to relevant authorities about the inconveniences caused by the traders. It was said that a construction company working on the road had also made appeal to the government to check the traders.

A senior policeman, who spoke to our correspondent on the condition of anonymity, said, “Ayuba and the policeman were posted to the area to chase away traders who had taken over that portion of the road. The road is under construction by Chinese Construction Engineering Company and the company had complained that its makeshift construction site was being hijacked by traders.

“On the day of the incident, Ayuba and another policeman were dispersing the traders when things went wrong.

“We were told that the traders overpowered the policemen and in an attempt to protect himself and his colleague, Ayuba opened fire into the crowd and killed a trader (Mohammed).

“Ayuba’s colleague immediately fled, leaving him alone with the hoodlums. The hoodlums seized Ayuba’s gun from him, picked up stones and sticks and beat him up without mercy.

“Some soldiers arrived at the scene and attempted to rescue the policeman. But the soldiers were greatly outnumbered by the uncontrollable mob, which overpowered them and chased them away.”

Our correspondent learnt that by the time the police back-up arrived and managed to disperse the mob, Ayuba was unconscious from the beatings he had received.

The policemen were said to have rushed Ayuba and Mohammed to the hospital where they were confirmed dead.

Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, told our correspondent that the matter had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba.

She said, “The matter is under investigation at the SCID. Investigations will reveal what happened.”"

Since the declaration of a state of emergency in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states on May 14, the road linking Maiduguri, Damdoa and Biu has been closed by men of the Joint Task Force, JTF, as the road links the Sambisa Game Forest.

It was learnt that since the beginning of the week, there had been killings in Biu, which centred around the popular Kadafur Cinema and other wards where a lecturer, who was also an Islamic cleric, three members of a family and four others were killed by the sect members.

The tragic incidents have created apprehension in the town.

It was learnt that some youths in the town yesterday staged a protest and also embarked on a house-to-house search to fish out the terrorists among them.

A source, who just arrived Maiduguri from Waka, said the town was no longer save, adding that the killings had created a state of anxiety among the people.

“In fact, most of the killings were targeted at school teachers and Islamic clerics. The most unfortunate thing is that the terrorists have devised a means of using knifes to slaughter their targets, as gunshots will attract security agencies,” the source said.

It was also gathered that men of the task force had been deployed on the streets of the town to ensure safety of lives and property, even as some youths have volunteered to assist the security agencies in apprehending those perpetrating the killings.

It was gathered that trouble started in Borno's town of Biu about 185 kilometres from the state capital Maiduguri, when the two groups confronted themselves in a claim of who should hunt for Boko Haram, in the territory.

Biu had witnessed series of killings and bombings carried out by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in recent times, the most recently being the killing last Tuesday of eight persons including a lecturer at the College of Education, Waka, Biu by the suspected terrorists, who were said to have invaded the town, after escaping from their camps in Sambisa and other camps in Borno and Yobe State during a military raid.

Abdullahi Mohammed who sustained gun shot injury during the incident and currently responding to treatment at an undisclosed hospital, confirmed the incident to journalists yesterday.

According to Mohammed, trouble started when a group of Civilian JTF from Maiduguri, the state capital, accompanied by soldiers, invaded Biu town in search of Boko Haram terrorists.

""The Civilian JTF in Biu had asked those that came from Maiduguri to leave the town because their presence in the town is likely to cause more harm than good to residents of Biu town,"" Mohammed said.

According to him, it was during the ejection of the Maiduguri Civilian JTF that fight ensued between the two youth groups, which led to the killing of five persons.

""I saw five dead bodies before I was rushed to hospital. It is possible the casualty figure may be more than five because only two of us survived the shooting, I can't tell where other dead bodies were deposited,"" Mohammed revealed.

The casualties were said to be mostly the local civilian JTF and other innocent civilians who were close to the scene of the incident.

Efforts to get the Joint Task Force (JTF) or the police to confirm the incident proved abortive as GSM services remain grounded in Borno State."

Suspected members of the violent Islamic sect, Boko Haram, on Tuesday stormed a roadblock mounted by the Joint Military Task Force in Yobe State and killed four soldiers and two policemen.

Gonori is about 50 kilometres away from Damaturu, the state capital.

The insurgents, numbering about 20, were said to have caught their victims unawares while they were relaxing at about 7pm. The attackers were said to have carried AK47 guns.

A security source who briefed our correspondents said, “Some people suspected to be Boko Haram members opened fire at a JTF roadblock and killed six security operatives on duty.

“Those who died include four soldiers and two policemen; some other soldiers who sustained gunshot wounds have been moved to the hospital.

“The suspected Boko Haram members might have been monitoring the roadblock and opened fire when they noticed that the soldiers were more relaxed; the attack took place in the evening.

A top security personnel at the Defence Headquarters on Wednesday confirmed the incident on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

The source said members of the Special Forces were still engaged in a gunfight in Yobe over the incident till late on Wednesday.

The Special Forces is an amalgam of security operatives raised to confront insurgents in the troubled North-East when the Federal Government declared a state of emergency in Yobo, Borno and Adamawa states a few months ago.

Security operatives on the trail of insurgents believed to be in possession of dynamites in Potiskum had shut down the town for a house-to-house search operation on Tuesday.

There was also the fear in security circles that the insurgents could use the explosives hijacked last week from Rick Rock Quarry, operated by a Pakistani in the Gulani Local Government Area of the state, to wreak havoc during the Eid-el-Fitr celebrations.

Spokesman for the JTF, Captain Eli Lazarus, reportedly said that the JTF decided to impose a 24-hour curfew on Potiskum in response to an intelligence report that the insurgents were planning attacks in the city with effect from Monday.

A source who confided in our correspondents on Wednesday said that the JTF had temporarily shut down the MTN communication in Yobe State in order to confront the development though the communication facilities had since been restored in the evening of Tuesday.

Efforts to get the Director of Defence Information, Brig. Chris Olukolade, to comment on the Yobe attack did not succeed as repeated calls to his mobile phone were not answered.

Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday admitted that members of Boko Haram took his government by surprise with their terror tactics.

Jonathan who spoke at the breaking of Ramadan fast with Muslim members of the Diplomatic Corps in the Presidential Villa, Abuja, regretted that the attacks being unleashed on Nigerians by the sect members had led to the killing of children, security agents and many other innocent persons.

He said, “In Nigeria, the security challenge we face is all too well-known. The activities of the Boko Haram sect, especially their tactics of terror, took us all by surprise.

“The mindless attacks of this group have led to the loss of innocent lives of children, law enforcement agents and other innocent citizens.

“However, it is significant to note that with commitment and fervent prayers to God by all who profess their faith in the supreme creator, we have achieved significant success in containing the menace of the sect.”

The President expressed the hope that the Ramadan season had imbued the peoples of the world with compassion and forgiveness to enable them to surmount the challenges of global conflicts and wars.

He urged the Muslim diplomats to always pray for Allah to intervene and help address the various challenges confronting all nations, especially nations facing civil strife, political instability and financial crisis."
1528,Rep escapes attack at APC inauguration,8/7/2013,,Ifako-Ijaye,Lagos,0,,,Sectarian Actor,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.punchng.com/news/rep-escapes-attack-at-apc-inauguration/,,,,,"Ifako-Ijaye, Lagos, Nigeria",Nigeria,"by Tunde Odesola, Simon Utebor, Gbenga Adeniji, Samuel Awoyinfa and Sodiq Oyeleke

Tragedy was averted on Wednesday in Lagos when a member of the House of Representatives, Chief Michael Ogunnusi, narrowly escaped being attacked by some aggrieved members of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria in Ifako-Ijaye Local Government, Lagos, during the inauguration of the All Progressives Congress in the council.

Trouble started when the lawmaker, who represents the council in the National Assembly while making a speech at the event announced a donation of N200,000 to augment efforts of the members and leaders across the ward levels in the council.

Ogunnusi’s speech came shortly after that of a former Special Adviser on Education in Lagos State, Mr. Elijah Adewale, who donated N50, 000 to every ward within the local government for the same purpose.

The lawmaker’s gesture angered many of the APC members, who rejected the money and disrupted the ceremony for what they termed “insult on them by the Reps member as if we are beggars.’’

The atmosphere was tense as Ogunnusi’s security aides made frantic efforts to whisk him away from the venue to save him from being attacked.

As they guarded him out of the vicinity, he was pelted with sachets of pure water by the rampaging youths. In the melee, chairs were broken and some party members and passers-by fled the area in different directions.

One of the aggrieved APC members, who spoke with our correspondent shortly after normalcy returned to the venue, said it was not the amount of the money that angered the members but the manner it was offered.

He said, ‘‘Since election ended in 2011, Ogunnusi has refused to attend meetings in the local government, claiming he was busy with state matters in Abuja. He was avoiding us like a plague and now he came to woo us with N200, 000 when election is approaching. He thinks we are beggars.’’

Another member, who gave her name as Kafayat, said, ‘‘What happened today is a proof that the electorate will no longer tolerate any member of the political class, who uses them during election and abandons them when he or she gets to position.”

Chairman of the defunct ACN in the council, Mr. Akintunde Fadayomi, said members of the party had always asked him to tell Ogunnusi to find time to attend the party meetings in the council.

Meanwhile, female politicians in the defunct ACN in Lagos have urged the leadership of the APC to carter for their rights under the new party.

The politicians who spoke through women leader of Oriade Local Council Development Area, Chief Simbiat Badmus, made the appeal during the inauguration of the APC in the LCDA on Wednesday.

Simbiat, who is the mother of a former Deputy Speaker in Lagos State House of Assembly, Bola Badmus, explained that the only way women could be rewarded for their effort was by giving them top political positions.

Also, chairman, Mushin Local Government Area, Mr. Babatunde Adepitan, described the APC as the hope for the oppressed in the country.

Adepitan said this during the inauguration of the newly-formed political party in Lagos on Wednesday, a statement by his Information Officer, Akinyemi Olusegun, said.

At the inauguration of the party in Ado Odo/Ota LG, the protem Chairman, Mr. Quawiy Salako, commended the efforts of the national protem chairman,Chief Bisi Akande and the national leader, Chief Bola Tinubu in building a formidable party.

Salako, who was supported by other party members from the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, All Nigeria Peoples Party among others, said the party would provide the dividends of democracy to the citizenry if voted into office.

In similar vein, the representative of Osun-East Senatorial District, Senator Babajide Omoworare, said the APC would liberate Nigeria from the grip of the Peoples Democratic Party.

In an Eid-il Fitri message by his Media Assistant, Mr. Tunde Dairo, Omoworare, on Wednesday, said the registration of APC in the month of Ramadan was symbolic."

Tragedy struck on Monday in Aba, Abia State when a policeman shot dead a revenue collector with the state government identified as Friday Dimofor. Daily Sun gathered that three policemen from Eziama police division, Corporal Paul, Constables Otuu James and Henry had gone to a spot on Obiora Road outside their area of assignment to arrest some indian hemp smokers.

On arrival at the place and without taking permission from the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ndiegoro Division, the policemen arrested a young man they alleged, was a hemp smoker. The young man, whose ide

ntity could not be immediately ascertained was said to have escaped from the policemen while dragging him towards their van.

In an attempt to re-arrest the fleeing ‘suspect’, one of the policemen was said to have fired in the direction of the young man.

But his shot missed target and hit Dimofor, 29, who was attending a meeting at Obiora Road.

Dimofor, a native of Agbaja, in Isiala Mbano Local Government of Imo State, but lived in Aba was immediately rushed to a private hospital by members of his club, while the policemen fled the scene. He was certified dead in the hospital moments later.

When it realised that he had killed somebody, Paul was said to have dashed back to his office, locked his gun inside his drawer, rushed back home and he hurriedly packed some of his belongings and left to an unknown destination with members of his household.

Following Dimofor’s death, members of his Club on Tuesday, staged a protest march round the city and would have burnt down Eziama police station, but for the prompt intervention of officer in-charge of SARS, Aba, Anari N. Anari who pleaded with the protesters.

When contacted, Abia State Commissioner of Police, Usman Tili Abubarkar who described the incident as a fallout of the failure of the DPO of Eziama station to have firm control of his men, said two of the cops who went on the illegal patrol had been arrested and that efforts would be made to arrest the fleeing cop.

Abubarkar said after investigation, those found culpable would be charged to court and urged members of the deceased’s club and the general public to remain calm as police would see that justice was done in the matter."

Kaduna State Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero

Unknown gunmen have attacked a Divisional Police Station in the Kajuru Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing three policemen, including a woman.

The gunmen were said to have attacked the police station at about 11.30pm on Monday and broke into the cell, freeing detained suspects.

“The gunmen stormed the police station in a commando style. They fired shots indiscriminately; we were clearly over-powered and we flee,” a policeman at the station during the attack said.

Our correspondent learnt that two policemen died on the spot during the attack while another one died on the way to St. Gerald Hospital, Kaduna.

Kajuru is about 30 minutes drive to Kaduna metropolis.

A source who would not want his name in print said some of the policemen who escaped the attack had to disguise themselves by pulling off their uniforms and ran into a nearby bush.

The source, a policeman, said, “We were not many and we couldn’t stand their sophisticated weapons. They killed three of our colleagues; an inspector and a sergeant were killed. Two of our colleagues sustained serious injuries and were rushed to the hospital in Kaduna. A female police officer died on the way to the hospital.

“They came around 11:30pm yesterday (on Monday) and they operated for about one hour. It was the mobile police located in a different location that save the situation; otherwise they would have started attacking residents of the town.

“If not for the intervention of the mobile police, it could have been hell for the residents of the area. They were many, they came in vehicles and they released all the suspects being detained in the cell and some of us immediately removed our uniforms and pretended as if we were also some of the suspects in the cell. That was how we survived, others managed to escape into the bush.”

Another source said it was unbelievable that the gunmen could attack the police station without any hindrance despite the presence of military operatives at various check-points on the road.

“Kajuru is just a 25 or 30 minutes drive from Kaduna, there are many checkpoints along the way, from Kaduna to Kajuru down to Kachia, Zonkwa and the entire part of the southern Kaduna, so it baffles us when things like this happened without any arrest,” he said.

Kaduna State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, Aminu Lawan, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed the attack but said that the command was yet to get details of the attack.

“We are still assessing the details and we will let you know when we are through,” he told our correspondent on Tuesday.

Kaduna State Governor Muktar Yero, in his reaction, urged security operatives in the state to launch an investigation into the incident and arrest the perpetrators.

Yero, who was on on-the-spot assessment on Tuesday, condemned the attack and urged the residents of the area to remain calm. He assured them that the state government was determined to tackle the activities of criminals bent on creating tension in the state.

“This ugly trend has to stop and we are committed to bringing the perpetrators of this attack to book,” he said.

The governor also promised to foot the hospital bills of the victims of the attack being treated at the St. Gerald Catholic Hospital."

THE police on Saturday rescued the kidnapped mother of a lawmaker representing Obio/Akpor Federal Constituency I in the House of Representatives, Mrs. Priscilla Chinda.

Madam Chinda was rescued by the anti-kidnap squad of the Rivers State Police Command in Abuloma axis of Port Harcourt at about 3am.

Three suspects were also arrested in connection with the abduction of the lawmaker’s mother, who was taken away from her residence in Elelewon, Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State, by unknown gunmen.

Speaking with SUNDAY PUNCH on the rescue of the octogenarian, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Angela Agabe, said some arms and ammunition were recovered from the suspects.

Agabe explained that investigation was still ongoing with a view to arresting other members of the gang responsible for the abduction of Mr. Kingsley Chinda’s mother.

“She (Madam Chinda) was rescued by the police at about 3am today (Saturday) from the hands of her abductors. Three suspects were also arrested during the raids of their (suspects) hideout while some weapons were recovered,” the state police spokesperson said.

However, son of the victim said in Port Harcourt that the release was made possible by the combined efforts of the police and other security agencies.

The lawmaker expressed gratitude to the police and operatives of the State Security Service for their effort in ensuring that his mother was rescued."

Boko Haram, whose member was apprehended at Gamboru/Ngala area of the state last week by the youth volunteers, stormed the town of Maiduguri Wednesday morning.

A member of Gwoza Emirate Council, who accompanied the Emir of Gwoza to Maiduguri to inform the state governor, said two policemen were killed in an attack on Gwoza Police Station at about 8:00 a.m. local time.

He said seven of the insurgents also died in the clash with policemen assisted by men of the Joint Task Force, who repelled the attack.

A security source also said the attack at Gamboru/Ngala occurred at about 2:00 a.m. on Wednesday.

Residents said the Boko Haram men attacked the town to avenge the arrest of one of their members by youth volunteers, civilian JTF from Maiduguri who came to launch the volunteer group at Gamboru-Ngala.

A resident said four people were killed when the insurgents opened fire into a house. Eight people sustained injuries from gunshots.

Gamboru/Ngala is a bustling community about 135 km east of Maiduguri, capital of Borno State. The town is also known as Boko Haram's stronghold.

The attack came after recent reports of the killing of several Boko Haram leaders.

The Nigerian military announced on Monday that the commander-in- chief of the sect, Abubakar Shekau, might have died in a recent fight with security operatives in Borno State.

There was commotion in Ibadan on Friday when Yoruba and Hausa traders clashed at Bodija Market, leaving at least five people injured while property worth millions of naira were destroyed, according to eyewitness.

Traders fled the market in the aftermath of the clash, leaving their stores open while food stuffs littered the entire market. At the entrance of the market, a commercial bicycle was set ablaze while the owner escaped with minor injuries.

A truck load of food stuffs was also vandalised inside the market. Traders with serious injuries were said to have been quickly taken to the hospital while police vans were stationed at strategic positions.

There were varied accounts of the cause of the clash but a credible source, Akeem Emiola, who is the Public Relations Officer, Ibadan Food Stuffs Sellers Association, Bodija Market, told our correspondent that there had been tension between the two groups since Yoruba traders were killed by Boko Haram members in Borno State.

On May 5, 2013, four traders were killed while 10 more were killed on June 28. 2013. Since the massacres were carried out, Yoruba traders had shunned the troubled zone, paving the way for Hausa traders to bring in food stuffs, especially beans from the North and sell at preferred prices.

Emiola said Friday’s clash was the climax of the tension that had been on the rise since the death of the 14 traders.

He said, “Since Boko Haram killed Yoruba traders from Bodija Market, traders could not go to the North to buy food stuffs but the Hausa traders have a means of sending the products especially beans to their kinsmen in Ibadan. The price has since risen beyond common man’s ability, which is a source of worry for the leadership of Bodija market union. There was tension in the market because only the Hausa traders have been selling beans in large quantity, leaving Yoruba traders idle.”

He added that there were rumours that a clash was imminent between the two ethnic groups, leading to a peace talk called by the community leaders in Bodija area, where all concerned parties were invited.

But a solution remained elusive until Friday, when the state Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Indabawa, invited all the parties involved to find a solution to the brewing crisis.

“On Friday, all the parties concerned met with the Commissioner of Police, where it was agreed that beans coming from the North should be divided equally between the two groups,” said Emiola. But the truce only lasted a few hours as tension reached a boiling point.”"

Jude Okwe in Calabar

In what looks like a revenge mission, pirates thursday, at Ikang Jetty in Bakassi Local Government Area of Cross River State, killed a policeman and a civilian.

Last Tuesday, officers and men of the Nigerian Navy (NNS Victory) Calabar gunned down four sea pirates near the Atlantic Ocean who attempted to rob a Camerounian vessel bound for Nigeria.

One out of the pirates on board an engine boat was captured alive while the other two disappeared in the sea. Two other boats loaded with other pirates escaped into the creeks.

The incident occurred in the wee hours of thursday night when some men emerged from a speed boat at the Atlantic Ocean end of the jetty without provocation opened fire on the border security patrol base at the jetty.

The border patrol team made up of the army, Customs Service, Police, Navy and other security agencies were taken unawares.

The State command of the Nigeria Police through its Police Public Relations Officer, Hogan Bassey, confirmed the incident saying the attack was unprovoked and that the command was yet to determine the cause.

He said they were on the trail of the criminals and assured the people that those involved would be brought to book.

At Ikang, it was learnt that the attack might not be unconnected with the Tuesday incident where navy killed some pirates along the Calabar waterways near the ocean.

The Nigerian Navy had engaged the pirates in a gun duel leading to the death of four of the robbers and arrest of one of them, as he refused to reveal the identity of the slain policeman saying until the family is informed.

Bassey had in an interview disclosed that he was an indigene of Akpabyuo Local Government Area which is not far from where the attack took place.

But some residents of Ikang who spoke to journalists said they were convinced that the attack was a revenge mission for the robbers killed earlier in the week.

One of the security men who pleaded anonymity said they thought the pirates were fishermen or residents of the area but while watching them disembark from their boat, the gun duel gunshot resulting in the death of their colleague and a civilian."

It was learnt that the suspects stormed the incident scene on speedboat at about 1:0am and opened fire on the victims.

The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Hogan Bassey, confirmed the incident.

Bassey said the attack was unprovoked and its cause was yet to be determined.

He said that security personnel would trail the suspects and arrested them for prosecution.

But a source, who did not want his name mentioned, said that the attack may a reprisal to an incident that occurred recently in which Naval personnel killed some suspected pirates along the Calabar waterways.

It will be recalled that the Navy, on Tuesday morning, in a shootout with some sea pirates, killed four of them and arrested one named Bassey Bassey.

Residents said they believed that yesterday’s attack was a revenge mission for the robbers that were killed earlier in the week."

Eyewitnesses said Joel was hit by a stray bullet while some customs officers were trying to apprehend a motorist who was smuggling a red Volkswagen bus from Benin Republic into Nigeria.

It was learnt that after the shooting, some residents took to the streets in protest. The residents were said to have alleged that customs officials had killed at least three motorists this month under the pretext that they were smugglers.

It was learnt that in the ensuing pandemonium, the customs officials stationed in the area fled. However, a Superintendent of Customs, identified as J. I Motojelu, was said to have been driving by at the time.

PUNCH Metro learnt that in retaliation, the angry mob, led by a community leader, dragged the officer out of his Toyota Corolla car marked ABJ 663 DW, and killed him.

It was learnt that the irate mob, also set the deceased officer’s vehicle ablaze and set up bonfires at the centre of the road.

The culprits were said to have used the opportunity to steal some items that had previously been seized by customs.

A police source said, “Motojelu, who knew nothing about the incident was beaten to death. The mob opened a customs patrol van stationed nearby and took a G3 rifle with 30 rounds of ammunition kept inside it. They then set the vehicle ablaze.”

Sources told our correspondent that some customs officials and policemen later returned to the scene and fired shots to disperse the mob.

Director, Lagos State Fire Service, Razaq Fadipe, said his men attempted to put out the fire but they had to retreat because of the sporadic gunshots in the area.

It was learnt that the victim had been rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.

But the NCS Public Relations Officer, Seme Command, Ernest Olattah, said in a statement that the officer was killed while on his way to attend a meeting at the command.

He said, “We announce the gruesome killing of one of our senior officers by some smugglers in the Ashipa area of Seme around 9.50am on Thursday. The deceased officer, while in his official uniform, unarmed, and driving to the command’s headquarters for a routine meeting, was accosted by a mob who forced him out of his vehicle.

“Led by an identified chief of the community, the officer was murdered in cold blood, while his vehicle was set ablaze.”

The customs spokesman said efforts were on to apprehend the culprits adding that the customs had achieved many feats this year alone.

He said NCS operatives, due to their uncompromising stance against smuggling and the protection the nation’s economy, had come under series of attacks by smugglers and some unpatriotic elements that saw smuggling as their rights.

The PRO said, “Customs Area Controller of Seme Border, Othman Abdu Saleh, has in collaboration with sister government agencies including the police, commenced moves to bring the perpetrators of the heinous crime to book. The controller posits that this unfortunate incident will not deter operatives of the command under his watch from carrying out their lawful duties.

‘’This is indeed a sad day for us here in this command, but let me emphasised that we are not relenting in the discharge of our duty as we will not allow the darkness of criminality to dampen the light of our service to Nigeria.”

Lagos Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, told our correspondent on the telephone that seven suspects had been arrested, adding that they would be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba.

She said, “Joel is recuperating at Badagry General Hospital while the slain customs officer has been deposited at the mortuary.”"

It was gathered that the assailants, numbering over 30 stormed Amune, a small community not far from Buladimbam around 12 am last Monday.

News of the attack broke only last night because of the difficult terrain and the cut-off of communication in the state.

A native of the village, Madina Azaki, who is a freelance journalist based in Abuja, said all those killed in the incident were her relations, and that it was a targeted attack.

A source in the village said the violence started when attackers killed one of the herders and whisked away another to an obscure camp located some kilometres away.

Madina Azaki said a day after this, the herdsmen mobilised themselves and traced the footsteps of the attackers in order to rescue their abducted kinsman.

""When my people approached the camp of the attackers, they were ambushed which resulted in the death of 16 people. The victims include the district head of Amune, Ba Lamin, who was my uncle. His son Abdallah was also killed and we strongly believe that the killing was carefully planned. Most of the victims are extensively rich and have no fewer than 500 cows,"" she said.

Madina said the killing marked the end of a generation in the settlement.

""The assailants have wiped away the village because they killed the bread winners. If you go there, you will only see women and young men who need help,"" she said.

There was no information on the attack from the police and Joint Task Force (JTF) in Borno State."

Four persons have been killed during an attack on two villages in Langtang South Local Government Area of Plateau State by gunmen suspected to be Fulani mercenaries. It was gathered that the attackers, who came through Yemani in Shendam Local Government, razed the two villages, Karkashi and Barrack. The Chairman of Taroh community in Wase Local Government, Jungle Luhdut, confirmed the incident yesterday while speaking with our correspondent in Jos, the state capital.

Luhdut said four people were killed, while all the houses in the two villages were burnt down. He said the attackers later fled through Taraba State, adding that the casualty figure wound have been high if not that the people had deserted the villages when they heard rumour of an impending attack. A resident, who did not want his name in print, said the attackers stormed the villages simultaneously with sophisticated weapons while shooting everything on sight.

A highly placed military source told our correspondent on Tuesday that about 65 others were missing as a result of the attack by the Islamic militants.

Investigations revealed that the insurgents attacked the soldiers in Kasiya Forests, north of Borno State.

It was learnt that the troops were left to face the heavily armed insurgents, who attacked them from different directions following the failure of the planners of the operation to give aerial support to the soldiers.

It was also gathered that soldiers involved in the ongoing campaign against the Boko Haram insurgents were firing indiscriminately into the air to protest against the killings which they described as strategic errors.

The soldiers were said to have demanded why the initial arrangement of aerial support was not provided to back the soldiers.

The source added that the casualty figure on the side of the Nigerian soldiers in the ongoing campaign against the insurgents had been on the high side as a result of repeated mistakes and communication inadequacies.

But the authorities of the Nigerian Army denied the report that it lost 40 soldiers with 65 others missing in a Boko Haram onslaught.

The Director of Army Public Relations, Brig. General Ibrahim Attahiru, said in an interview with our correspondent on Tuesday that soldiers of the 81 Battalion under the new created Division ‘7’ of the Nigerian Army carried out a raid on a Boko Haram hideout in Kasiya Forests of Ngazai Local Government Area of Borno State which resulted in a prolonged gun duel with the insurgents.

The Army spokesman said the invading troops of the Nigerian Army killed 150 of the insurgents and lost 15 men in the encounter, adding that nine other soldiers were still missing.

According to him, a wanted Boko Haram commander, Abba Goroma, was among those killed in the battle at the Kasiya Forest.

He said that the insurgents were well armed with anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons mounted on their vehicles.

He said, “On the 12th of September 2013, troops of 81 Battalion under ‘7’ Division of the Nigerian Army carried out a deliberate attack on an insurgent camp at Kasiya Forest.

“During the attack, a fierce battle ensued between our soldiers and the insurgents which lasted several hours.

“The insurgents were completely routed and the camp cleared. Over 150 insurgents died. On our own side, we lost one officer, a lieutenant and 15 soldiers, and nine other soldiers are still missing.

“The insurgent camp was well fortified with anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons mounted on vehicles.

“One Abba Goroma, one top insurgent commander was killed, he was a high valued target, he had a bounty of N10m on his head.”

Similarly, the Director of Defence Information, Brig.-Gen. Chris Olukolade, said the operation at the Kasiya forest was carried out by ground forces with aerial support.

He confirmed that the camp had a high concentration of armed insurgents who were shooting wildly as the Nigerian troops turned the heat on them.

He said that even though, investigation into the operation had commenced, it had nothing to do with any operational shortcoming.

On the issue of the protest and anger exhibited by soldiers in Borno State over the killing of soldiers by the insurgents, he said that such a thing could not have happened considering the high level of discipline exhibited by the soldiers since the commencement of the operation."

Two policemen, his security aides, were however, unlucky as they sustained various degrees of gunshot wounds during an exchange of fire with the attackers.

One of the speaker’s aide, who revealed this in a chat with The Guardian, said that the incident, which took place at about 4.50 p.m. at Bade Forest, along Jos/Keffi road would have been fatal but for brave intervention of his security aides.

The injured policemen, whom The Guardian learnt are presently receiving medical attention in one of state hospitals, were said to have fought gallantly to prevent the assassins from demobilising the vehicle that was conveying the speaker. The pilot car and one of the aides’ vehicles were riddled with bullets.

Commenting on the incident, the state Governor Danbaba Danfulani Suntai expressed shock over the attack “on the convoy of the Speaker, Haruna Tsokwa.”

Suntai, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Hassan Mijinyawa observed that the incident calls “for prayer and urged the security agencies to as a matter of urgency investigate this criminal attack,” adding “Taraba State today needs peace, security and greater political accommodation.”

Wondering why some persons would want to terminate the lives of a fellow human being, the governor further beckoned on “All Taraba citizens to continue praying for the continued peace and progress of the state.”

Also confirming the incident to The Guardian, the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, who was also in the convoy, Tanko Kaura, said “the speaker is in good condition,” adding, “Nothing happened to him.”

The speaker, who according to Kaura, was on his way to Abuja after undergoing three days retreat in Obudu, Cross Rivers State, disclosed that his convoy ran into the waiting hands of the attackers.

Kaura, who said the convoy was taken unawares was, however, not able to say whether the attackers were armed bandits or assassins.

While a section of the public linked the attack to the ongoing impasse in the state, some were, however, of the opinion that it was the handiwork of armed bandits and not unknown gunmen as the people were made to believe.

A senior police officer, who spoke to our report said: “Though I was not there but with the information made available to us, I think the attackers are armed robbers because I learnt that a lot of commuters have earlier been dispossessed of their valuables before the speaker convoy arrived at the scene.”

The police officer that would not want his name in print said the road is well known all over the country as “a haven of hoodlums,” adding: “Assassins would not have carried out such an attack on such place.”

Some schools of thought, however, disagreed with the police, linking the attack to the political impasse in the state, which many believed was being spearheaded by the speaker.

The aide who was among the convoy told The Guardian that “I cannot tell categorically if the attackers were armed robbers or persons sent to eliminate the speaker but with what I saw, it would be difficult for me to believe that they are mere thieves.

“Whatever they called them, I thank God that we all escaped and I pray that the state government would give much-needed medical attention to the two policemen that were injured because we don’t know what would have happened to us or the speaker if not for the courageous acts of the police.”"

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people are feared dead in a fresh attack by members of the Boko Haram sect in northeast Nigeria's Borno State, a top security source said on Friday.

Bulablin Ngaura along Damboa-Maiduguri road, where about 15 people were recently killed, came under attack again, this time claiming the lives of 17 civilians and three policemen, said the source who craved anonymity.

""The policemen escorting a bullion van belonging to a bank in the area were hit by the gunmen who tried to intercept the vehicle on Thursday,"" the source said.

The other 17 victims were identified as motorists plying the Damboa end of the road, 58 km away from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.

Abu Balami, a resident who witnessed the massacre, said the gunmen were armed to the teeth.

The revelation about Boko Haram's latest attack came more than 48 hours after the Borno State Environmental Protection Agency (BOSEPA) claimed they picked about 87 corpses from nearby bushes and highways after the insurgents attacked Benisheik area of the state on Tuesday.

Activities of the Boko Haram sect have recently been on the increase in Borno, a state in the northeastern region of Nigeria, which shares a border with Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

In April, the Nigerian government tried to broker a ceasefire with the sect but failed.

The Boko Haram sect seeks to enshrine the Islamic sharia law into the constitution and declares war against the Western education.

State Security Service

The shooting by security operatives at an uncompleted building behind Apo Legislative Quarters, Abuja last Friday which claimed eight lives took a new turn yesterday as Garki Modern Market Traders Association vowed to drag the security service to court claiming those who were killed were its members and were innocent.

This is just as the death toll in the shooting has risen to 10 as one of the injured victims died yesterday at the hospital.

One of the survivors recounted his experience giving a graphic detail of how the incident happened.

Traders Association to sue DSS

Garki Modern Market Traders' Association has started briefing its lawyers with a view to dragging the Department of State Service, DSS,to court over the killing of its members at an uncompleted building, behind the Apo Legislative Quarters, in Abuja, last week.

The Secretary of the association, Murtala Abubakar, said that they had already reported the murder of their members to the Senate and the National Human Rights Commission for appropriate actions against the murderers.

Abubakar lamented: ""Those people are eligible traders trading in our market so I don't see why they should be killed.""

According to him, ""We lost two of our members as now, while eight were seriously wounded by the soldiers who shot them at close range. Five others are missing as we speak.

""The security agents did not recover anything not even a gun. They were just saying that our members opened fire on them but they were just saying it to cover up because they don't have any proof that these people are Boko Haram""

Abubakar added that the DSS was still holding two of the association's members who were arrested on Friday morning as they went back to collect their property from the scene of massacre.

Abuja Keke Napep Chairman, Musa Ibrahim

""We are here this morning to take the remaining two bodies from the mortuary although one of the bodies has been here in AsokoroHospital mortuary since Friday.

""We took seven bodies and gave them to their relatives since the day of the attack. The body that was deposited in mortuary was as a result of our not being able to get in touch with the family.

""We have been able to establish contact with all the families of the slain men. Meanwhile, we just lost another victim who was rushed to the hospital that Friday. His name was Nasiru Adamu, and hailed from ZamfaraState.

""The seven that were killed that day were all our Keke NAPEP members; we issued them with identity cards, which they were carrying at the time of their death.

""They had lived in that uncompleted building for over two years and were paying N200 weekly to the security guard of the building as a caretaker of the landlord."

An online portal, SaharaReporters, said that at least five persons were killed in the fighting.

The agency said the bloody clash was also confirmed by an elderly Yoruba resident of Kafanchan, an otherwise quiescent town that used to be known as a railway hub. The man said the assaults flared up again yesterday, after armed soldiers had earlier quelled a skirmish last Sunday.

The security operative disclosed that indigenes of Southern Kaduna and Hausa-Fulani youths engaged in a free-for-all fight using machetes, spears and a few guns. Apart from the dead, many people reportedly sustained varying degrees of injury.

The source said, “I can confirm to you that attacks started yesterday between the indigenes and settlers. And several people were killed before [the] government declared 24 hours curfew today. As we speak, we are in the streets patrolling and all residents are now indoors.”

The security agent said yesterday’s attack appeared to be reprisals for the death of a young man who was killed last Sunday.

SaharaReporters could not reach the Kaduna State Police Commissioner, Mr. Olufemi Adenaike. However, a police officer in Kaduna said the commissioner and military authorities in Kaduna had deployed troops to the trouble spots to strengthen security and contain any threats that might escalate attacks."

ABUJA, NIGERIA (Worthy News)– Herdsmen killed 15 Christians in Nigeria’s Kaduna state early Saturday morning when Fulani Muslims assaulted the Christian village of Zangang.

They were killing the villagers and burning down houses, the Rev. Yakubu Gandu Nkut told Morning Star News.

The Fulani Muslims laid siege to the village while attacking Christians with guns and burning down their houses, Nkut said.

Nkut, pastor of an Evangelical Church in Zankan, said the gunmen also had machetes and knives.

Kumai Badu, chairman of the Kaura Local Government Council, told Morning Star News by phone that in addition to the 15 Christians killed, others were wounded and hundreds more displaced.

The attack was the third time this year that Muslim herdsmen had attacked Christians and destroyed their property in Zangang village.

Christians make up just more than half of Nigeria’s 158 million while Muslims account for 45 percent, according to Operation World."

The little girl, who spoke to PUNCH Metro while trying to fight back tears, said her father was killed after challenging policemen over an accident along the Mangoro end of Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.

She said, “My daddy was driving home when someone hit his car. He went to see the policemen; they just brought out their guns and shot him. They then ran away.”

Another occupant of the vehicle, Lateef Okesola, who expressed shock at the incident, said it occurred in broad daylight.

He said, “Adeniji, Mariam and I, were all in his Honda car; Adeniji was driving. We were headed towards Agege when we saw a white police patrol vehicle with the inscription, OPS Attack, chasing a commercial bus. So, Rafiu swerved to the side and allowed the vehicle to pass.

“We continued on our journey but after a while, we found ourselves behind the same bus. Suddenly, the driver of the bus applied his brake.”

Unfortunately for Adeniji, he couldn’t stop his car fast enough as his vehicle was said to have hit the bus from behind, causing Okesola to sustain a bruise on his head. An argument was said to have ensued between the bus driver and Adeniji after the motorist demanded payment for the repair of the bus.

The deceased allegedly told the bus driver to blame the policemen for causing the accident.

“The policemen were parked on the side of the road and when Rafiu approached them to discuss what had happened, one of them alighted and shot him in the chest before fleeing.

“It was the sympathisers who gathered, that flagged down another commercial bus to take us all to the Isokoko Police Division,” Okesola added.

After obtaining a police report, Adeniji was taken to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, where he was confirmed dead.

Not long after his corpse was taken to his family home at Oshodi, Adeniji was said to have been rushed to a private hospital after a sympathiser claimed he saw the corpse move.

However, Adeniji was confirmed dead again at Jericho hospital.

When our correspondent visited Adeniji’s mother’s home located on Samura Street, sympathisers were seen coming in droves to condole with his aged mother said to be in her 70s.

PUNCH Metro gathered that Adeniji was an employee of NAHCO. His colleagues, who came to sympathise with the family, described him as a hardworking man.

Elder sister of the deceased, Titilayo Akintunde, described the incident as a nightmare, saying there was a need for the government to curb the excesses of policemen.

She said, “One wonders why it is those that are paid to protect lives and property that “continue to add sorrows to our lives in this country.

“My brother was not a thug. He was gainfully employed at NAHCO. He had a wife and two children. Unfortunately, his life was cut short in his prime.

“The case is even more pathetic because he was killed in the presence of his six-year-old daughter and she has refused to eat since the incident. It is a sight that she will never “forget. We want justice for him. Imagine what our mother is going through right now?”

When contacted on the telephone, the Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, Damasus Ozoani, said, “There was a shooting in Agege area which led to loss of life. The patrol team within that area has been arrested and their arms have been taken for ballistic examination.”"

The incident, Nigerian Tribune gathered, took place in Ntok Enyin Nto Uno, Ikot Ekpene Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, where a former council head, Honourable Usen Ekene, was kidnapped and kept in the forest for three weeks.

A combined force of the police and men of the State Security Service (SSS) who acted on a tip-off were said to have stormed the kidnappers’ den even as they engaged in a gun battle with the suspected kidnappers.

The high fire power of the police overpowered that of the hoodlums leaving two of them dead and in return, the kidnappers killed one police corporal, got one SSS man seriously injured even as the kidnapped victim was killed in annoyance for the loss of their colleagues.

A family member, who confided in our reporter, disclosed that the kidnappers demanded a ransom of N50 million which was on the high side, considering the financial situation of the victim’s family and as such, he was detained in the forest for three weeks by the kidnappers.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Etim Dickson, who confirmed the incident, said the loss of the corporal and the victim that they went to rescue was a big blow on the command.

According to him: “Well, we did not only lose the man, we also lost one of our police corporals in the process. It is a big blow on our command. You see, these are some of the things we suffer as a result of doing our job.

“You know this issue of rescuing people at a joint operation is not an easy task. One of the officers in the SSS who was also in the operation got injured and two corpses of the kidnappers had been picked.

“The kidnappers had the boldness to shoot at the police and the police shot their colleagues down. We were unable to rescue the man.

“But what I am not sure is whether the man died in the process. What I am told is that the man was an old man, kidnapped for three weeks, keeping him in that forest, the man might have been exhausted. I learnt he died on the way while being rushed to the hospital.”"

A fierce gunfight launched against the fundamentalist Islamist group, Boko Haram, by Camerounian soldiers has led to the killing of no fewer than 180 insurgents and two gendarmes around a Nigerian border with Cameroun.

It was gathered that during the battle which took place on Tuesday evening, many of the wounded insurgents were also arrested.

About 200 rifles, 70 machine guns and heavy military hardware were said to have been recovered from the insurgents by the soldiers.

A reliable military source confirmed the development to our correspondent shortly after the the Nigerian Army in Kano State disclosed that it had foiled a plot to bomb Kano during the forthcoming Sallah festival by uncovering a bomb factory in Gezawa Local Government Area.

It was gathered that the Camerounian authorities directed the soldiers to launch the attack against the Nigerian gunmen, who had earlier on Tuesday, ambushed and killed two gendarmes on patrol in the border community.

Our source said the soldiers, while pursuing the insurgents, sent a signal to their Nigerian counterparts, to be on the alert to avoid the escape of the fleeing insurgents.

According to the source, the number of those killed, the arrests and the recovered arms indicated that many Boko Haram members, who were forced out of Nigeria through military operations, had already “settled comfortably” in Cameroun.

He said, “The Camerounian troops have been involved in a serious confrontation with the insurgents. They have killed over 180 of them.

“Almost 200 rifles and 70 machine guns were recovered from them by Camerounian soldiers.

“What led to this operation was that the insurgents killed two gendarmes on patrol around the border with Nigeria on Tuesday. I think this angered them to order a comprehensive raid of the hideouts of the insurgents.

“You can see from the casualty figure and the level of seizures that they were already comfortable in that part of Cameroun until this incident.

“Ironically, the Camerounians who had been reluctant in spite of complaints by Nigeria at the diplomatic level are the ones now reaching out to us to ensure that the fleeing insurgents are not allowed to escape. So, I can tell you that the heat is on them.”

It was also gathered that Nigerien soldiers in the Multinational Joint Task Force killed an unspecified number of Boko Haram members on some island communities near Lake Chad on Sunday.

Investigations revealed that the Nigerien component of the MNJTF went after the insurgents on learning of the killing of one of them.

Our source said the intensified military action against the insurgents had made the nation’s northern border rather too hot for them.

When our correspondent contacted the Director of Defence Information, Brig.-Gen Chris Olukolade, he said, “Our neighbouring countries, either through the instrumentality of the Multi National Joint Task Force or through their security instruments, are involved in operations to complement what we are doing against terrorism.

“I am aware that the MNJTF and Nigerian security agencies are combing everywhere for any strange movement in our territory,” Olukolade said.

Also in Abuja on Wednesday, the Commander ‘3’ Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen Illiyasu Abba, said that operatives raided a house in Gunduwawa, Gezawa LGA and discovered a bomb factory.

He told journalists at a press briefing in Kano that bomb making items recovered from the factory were meant to carry out attacks in Kano during the Sallah and other festivals this year.

A young man suspected to be a child of the owner of the house rented out to the suspected terrorists was shot dead.

Abba said, “At about 2 am on October 8, a combined team of the JTF troops and Department of State Services raided two Boko Haram terrorists’ hideouts at Gunduwawa village in the Gezawa Local Government Area.

“The raid, which was conducted following a lead on intelligence reports, made no arrests as the terrorists fled the village on the approach of the JTF troops and DSS personnel.

“The weapons and other dangerous materials were meant to wreak havoc on Kano during the Eid-el-Kabir and other festivities before the end of the year.’’

He listed Improvised Explosive Devices, ‘two AK 58 with 193 rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition, one AK 47 magazine with 107 rounds of 5.56 millimeter ammunition, bows and arrows as some of the recovered items.

Three primed cylinders of IEDs, one primed explosive suicide back pack, 18 empty IED cylinders, 24 detonators, a small bag of fertiliser, IED timers cortex wires, three remote control devices, five Motorola hand held radios, four communicators, six alarm clocks, two cartons of nine -volt batteries, a scale, one external hard drive and one heavy duty charger/battery were also recovered from the house."

An uncle of the deputy governor, whose name could not be immediately ascertained, was equally said to have been abducted by the kidnappers.

The kidnappers were said to have entered and left the town through the Calabar waterways on speedboats at about 2am and operated for over an hour.

Our correspondent, who visited Creek Town on Friday, learnt that the kidnapers had initially burst into the residence of the brother of the Director-General of the Directorate of Security Service, Mr. Ita Ekpenyong, but only succeeded in vandalising the building as the brother, identified as Chief Asuquo Aka, was not at home.

A source, who preferred anonymity, said the heavily armed men accompanied by Alsatian dogs came in from the Bakassi area of the waterways with two flying boats.

He said, “They broke the wall of the deputy governor’s father’s house to gain access to the building. They also vandalised the building where the younger brother of the director-general of SSS is staying. The house is believed to be a family compound. But they faced stiff resistance from security agents.”

No fewer than persons were feared killed in the early hours of Sunday at Ogwule-Ankpa in Agatu, Benue State when people suspected to be Fulani marauders invaded the area. The attack was coming four days after gunmen, suspected to be Fulani herdsmen killed 21 natives of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of neighbouring Plateau State.

Governor Gabriel Suswam expressed disappointment at the renewed invasion of 21 communities in spite of peace moves by the state government to end the ugly trend.

According to sources, many of the victims were murdered in their sleep between 4 am and 5 am when the gunmen stormed the villages.

Another source said the gunmen also invaded a mosque, killing four persons, with several others sustaining gun shot injuries. Houses and household items worth millions of naira were not spared also during the attack.

Governor Suswam who was accompanied by his deputy, Chief Stephen Lawani and security chiefs in the state were in Agatu yesterday on sympathy visit to the affected communities and to inspect the extent of destruction.

Speaking at the Catholic Church, Oshigbudu, following his visit to Enogaje, one of the communities, attacked by the marauders during previous onslaughts, the Governor lamented the incessant attacks on Benue people and urged the people to be security conscious and report suspicious movements to relevant security agencies.

He called on those who fled their villages in the wake of the crises to return home as adequate security will be provided for them.

Suswam who also promised to provide motorcycles to facilitate easy movement of security operatives in the area, made cash donations to many of the affected communities."

Sixteen days after he was abducted by kidnappers, Justice Daniel Okungbowa of the Edo State High Court, has regained his freedom in the early hours of yesterday.



The state high court judge was abducted while on his way to the Ekpoma division of the high court, three weeks after the release of human rights lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN).

The Benin branch of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), had boycotted courts in protest over Okungbowa’s abduction. The protest grounded activities at the state judiciary for over two weeks.

According to the News Agency o Nigeria (NAN), Justice Okungbowa was released at 2a.m. by his abductors.

It was further learnt that his release was delayed due to negotiation between the kidnappers and the family over the ransom demanded. It was not confirmed whether ransom was paid or not.

The Edo State Police Commissioner, Mr. Foluso Adebanjo, who confirmed his release, said the state high court judge had rejoined his family.

Adebanjo did not give details of how the judge was released. There was jubilation at the Benin City branch of the NBA, when the news came that the judge had been released.

Mr. Sam Abasilim, a member of the NBA, Benin City, also confirmed the release.

Meanwhile, two wives of a prominent Edo businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Iyayi Efianayi, were Sunday morning kidnapped by six armed men on their way to church.

According to ionigeria.com sources, the two women – Mrs. Grace Iyayi, 72, and Mrs. Christiana Iyayi, 65, were abducted by the daredevil hoodlums along Boundary Road near Ogbetuo Avenue junction, GRA, Benin City.

The two elderly women, our sources further revealed were in the same car with another lady in the front passenger seat and a driver. Unknown to them the two vehicles behind them (a Toyota Sienna bus and a Toyota Corolla car) carrying the kidnappers were trailing them.

Immediately they got to Ogbetuo Avenue junction, the Sienna bus overtook and blocked their car while the Corolla was also used to block the car from behind. Four armed men alighted from the two vehicles, pointed their guns at the driver and the lady in the front seat and ordered them to open the doors of the car.

The two elderly ladies were pulled out of their cars into the Sienna bus and they sped away. The Toyota Corolla, which ostensibly must have been stolen for the operation was abandoned.

As at the time of this report, the kidnappers had not made any contact with the victims’ family members. Their phones are also switched off"

According to a military statement, Islamist fighters ""of unknown strength attempted coordinated and simultaneous attacks"" on Sunday in three remote towns in northeastern Borno state, Boko Haram's historic stronghold.

Troops ""successfully repelled all the attacks killing 40 terrorists in the three locations,"" the towns of Bama, Gwoza and Pulka, said the statement from the army's 7 Division, based in the northeast.

Nigeria launched a major offensive in the northeast in mid-May aimed at crushing Boko Haram's four-year insurgency, which has left thousands dead.

Military officials have described the campaign as a success and have released details of operations that have purportedly killed hundreds of insurgents, including several top Boko Haram commanders.

But Islamist attacks have continued, with scores of defenceless civilians, including more than 100 students, massacred since July.

After the most recent student massacre on September 29 in northeastern Yobe state, Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan called for a review of the military campaign and ordered new strategies be developed to curb the violence.

The mobile phone network has been switched off in much of the northeast since the operation began, a tactic the military said would block Boko Haram from coordinating attacks.

But with witnesses and local officials largely unreachable, the military's accounts of clashes have been difficult to verify.

Boko Haram has said it is fighting to create an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north.

The southern half of the country, Africa's most populous and top oil producer, is mostly Christian."

The Police Command in Bayelsa has confirmed the kidnap of Mrs Augusta Douglas-Ayam, the elder sister to Mr Oronto Douglas, the Special Adviser to the President on Research, Documentation and Strategy.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Douglas-Ayam was kidnapped at about 8 p.m. on Monday night in Ogbia town by unknown gunmen.

The Commissioner of Police, Mr Hilary Opara, who confirmed the incident to newsmen on Tuesday in Yenagoa, said he had just returned to the state capital after visiting the scene of the kidnap at Ogbia town.

Opara said that no arreast had been made but that the Marine Police had been deployed to the creeks to effect the rescue of the victim.

When contacted, the spokesman for state's Police Command, Mr Alex Akhigbe (DSP) told NAN on phone that officers from Anti-Kidnapping Squad had been deployed to go after the kidnappers.

``We are after the kidnappers and very soon, they will be apprehended and the woman rescued,’’ he assured.

Meanwhile, Mr Gift Douglas, a younger brother to President's aide who lives in Abuja, told NAN on phone that he received information about the kidnap of his sister on phone on Monday night.

``I got the information this night that our elder sister has been kidnapped by gunmen who went to her shop at about 8 p.m. and shot into the air before taking her away through the creeks.''.

He said that the incident had thrown the entire family into mourning.

Meanwhile, the Bayelsa Government has expressed shock and disbelief over the incident.

The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr. Markson Fefegha said that the report of the kidnap came as a shock but that the state government remained resolute in its determination to stamp out criminal activities in the state.

``It is sad and embarrassing that it happened at a time the present administration is recording great successes in the area of sustaining the existing peace.

``The state government is, however, optimistic that the security agencies will go after the kidnappers and swiftly rescue her,'' Fefegha said. (NAN)

Uyabeme said the suspects at about 11am parked a black Toyota Camry with fake number plate AG 19 WWR.

He said the occupants of the vehicle were lurking somewhere in the area.

The police spokesman said this prompted a team of policemen on duty around the company to approach the hoodlums.

“The criminals, on seeing that the team was close to them, opened fire on the policemen and during the gun duel, two suspects were gunned down, while others escaped with bullet wounds.

Our correspondent gathered on Monday that youths of the two neighbouring communities at Olorunda Local Government Area of Osun State engaged each other in a bloody fight on Sunday evening.

Two persons were reportedly injured while some other houses were burnt alongside the palace of the monarch of Oba Oke. Those who sustained injuries were said to be receiving treatment in a hospital at Osogbo, the state capital.

Some policemen deployed to quell the uprising were also said to have narrowly escaped being killed as some of the hoodlums opened fire on the police van which brought them to the troubled zone. However, the warring parties were eventually overpowered and normalcy was restored in the area.

Sources in Oba Oke told our correspondent on the telephone that violence broke out when the people of Oba Ile moved to a parcel of disputed land in Oba Oke after celebrating Oro festival, a move that was said to have triggered the fight.

Some resident of Oba Ile, however, claimed that the people of Oba Oke were the aggressors in the crisis which led to a breakdown of law and order.

They said the monarch of Oba-Ile, Oba Adebisi Adeeyo, and the people of the town were celebrating their Oro festival but youths from Oba Oke started the crisis by preventing them from going on with their celebration.

It was gathered that the warring youths from the two communities freely used axes, machetes and guns which forced many to stay indoors.

The two communities are said to have turned the clash between them into an annual ritual.

The Commissioner of Police in the state, Mrs. Dorothy Gimba, confirmed the incident in a statement by the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs. Folasade Odoro.

The CP stated that the situation had been brought under control by men of the command, who stopped the crisis from degenerating into a total breakdown of law and order.

The statement read, “We received information from Oba police post that some men were fighting with dangerous weapons; that they had moved to the Oloba Oke palace and set the palace ablaze.

“No person was injured. The Oloba of Oba-Oke, Oba Dahunsi Iyiola, whose palace was razed down before police arrival, was rescued from the scene unhurt.

“It happened that Oloba of Oba-Ile, Adebisi Adeeyo, was celebrating Oro festival and some youths prevented others from passing across their boundary.”"

Political thugs suspected to be agents of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have attacked the sub-state office of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA), in Abia State located at Umuopara, Umuahia.

Condemning the attack while speaking with Daily Sun, the PPA chairman in the state, Chief Emeka Okafor, said it was unfortunate that the ruling party in the state had started mobilizing thugs to disrupt meetings and destroy property of opposing political parties in the state in the guise of politicking.

Recounting what happened prior to the incident, Okafor said his party opened the office barely a week ago. “When we paid rent for the office space, somebody, who was acting for the ruling party, came to the caretaker of the house to induce him with double amount of what we paid, so, that he could refund us our money, but the caretaker refused.

“Then, in the evening of the same day, some thugs working for the PDP in the state came to our office, cut down the sign post, defaced the outer walls that had our party’s colour before vandalising the entire office,” he said.

Okafor, who recalled that “this was how kidnapping which nearly brought the state on its knees started,” said that it was unfortunate that violence had crept into politics in the state at this point in time.

“It is wrong to empower youths to engage in thuggery in the state in the name of politics.

“This was how kidnapping started because after empowering the youths to do this kind of job and afterwards, there are no jobs for them, they will take to crime,” he said, adding that it baffled him that PDP which claimed that PPA was dead in the state could go all out to hire thugs to attack its office.

He stressed that no amount of intimidation would stop the party from waxing stronger and taking back the state in 2015.

“The other day, thugs from the same PDP attacked the venue of a meeting of an opposition party in Isiala Ngwa South Local Government and wounded some people. May be, they are trying to create the false impression that no opposition party exists in the state, but it can not work,” he further said.

The PPA state chairman advised the PDP to find a way of ensuring that the government in the state provides dividends of democracy which the people are yearning for, instead of dissipating energy in fighting opposition parties in the state."

According to the statement, the police at Ovwian Aladja received a distress call from a resident of the area and immediately mobilised to the scene.

The victim, one Mr. Foluso Ogundare of Emure Ekiti, died from gunshots received in the attack on members of Bamidele’s support group, Ekiti Bibiire Coalition, during a meeting at Ward 3 in Emure, in the Emure Local Government Area of the state.

Ogundare died late on Sunday at the Federal Medical Centre, Ido Ekiti, where he was rushed after suspected political thugs attacked the EBC members.

Another victim, Mrs. Beatrice Ige, was on Monday receiving treatment at the state university teaching hospital in Ado Ekiti, our correspondent reports.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Command, Victor Babayemi (ASP), on Monday confirmed the attack and said the police had commenced investigation into the matter.

“We found out that the attack happened during a village meeting at Emure on Sunday. But, I can’t confirm to you that it was a fight between groups within a political party or not. We are on the trail of the suspected killers,” Babayemi told our correspondent.

A statement by Bamidele’s spokesman, Ahmed Salami read, “Two members of Ekiti Bibire Coalition were shot during an attack on members of the group in Emure Ekiti by some desperate elements and political appointees in broad day light.

“In the process, two members of the group were shot at close range and in various parts of their bodies. Specifically, Foluso Ogundare was shot in the stomach and later died at about 10.25pm on Sunday night at Federal Medical Centre, Ido Ekiti while Mrs. Beatrice Ige was shot in the buttock.

“We must place on record that this is one murder too many and it is suggestive of a high level of political desperation, intolerance and impunity.

“As stakeholders, we recall that during the struggle for the actualisation of his mandate, Governor Fayemi said, ‘no blood of an Ekiti man is worth shedding.’

“He equally emphasised that he was not desperate to rule Ekiti. But with the current scenario characterising the politics of the state, one is constrained to believe the assertion in many quarters that all these were mere rhetoric”.

Both Bamidele and Fayemi belong to the All Progressives Congress.

But the APC in a statement also on Monday condemned the attack and accused members of the EBC of turning into bullies.

The statement by the party’s Director of Publicity and Media, Segun Dipe, said, “The APC viewed the act as one of the bloodletting exercises, which the Michael Opeyemi Bamidele-led Bibiire Group has embarked on.”

The statement, which defended the Fayemi administration, further read, “Some miscreants hiding under the name of Bibiire Group have turned themselves into bullies while jostling for relevance. In the particular occurrence at Emure Ekiti, two MOB factions were allegedly locked in supremacy contest.

“One was led by one Supo Fakunle, a.k.a Olugeri; and the other led by Paul Awopetu, a.k.a Doki. They were allegedly fighting for the loot coming from MOB and his sponsors to whichever group emerged as superior.”

Reacting to the incident, a governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ekiti, Prince Dayo Adeyeye, said the situation in the state had become worrisome and warned of imminent anarchy.

Adeyeye, a former spokesman of the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, in a statement said, “There is a possibility of anarchy in Ekiti State if the police and other security agencies in the state fail to bring perpetrators of the killings to justice.

“The State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; his party, the All Progressives Congress; and most importantly, the State Police Command must be blamed for the latest killing.

“Therefore, if the police and other security agencies in the country do not want anarchy in Ekiti State, those who murdered Foluso Ogundare in Emure-Ekiti must be arrested, prosecuted and punished.”"

The fragile peace in Warri, the commercial hub of Delta State, snapped yesterday as bandits stormed the city.

The gunmen, who stormed the city at about 1pm, made futile attempts to invade an old generation bank located near NNS Delta, Warri Naval Base. It was learnt that the bandits trailed a customer, who was suspected to have withdrawn a huge amount of money, to the bank.

Investigation revealed that the suspects were repelled by a policeman attached to the bank, a development which infuriated the gunmen and led to intensive gun battle. The gun battle threatened the peace of the city.

The policeman killed one of the suspects while he was lucky to have survived.

The policeman sustained serious gunshot injuries and was immediately admitted at the intensive care unit of Warri Central Hospital. The gunmen escaped from the scene amidst staccato of gunshots which caused apprehension among residents.

Residents and owners of business premises scampered into safety while the hostility lasted.

The panic-gripped residents sent text messages to their loved ones at other parts of the city to avoid the troubled spot. Consequently, financial institutions and business premises in the troubled scenes were forced to shut down as a result of the security breach.

Worst hit were traders at Warri Main Market, who hurriedly closed down as sporadic gunshot rend the air opposite the market. It will be recalled that some bandits stormed the market in December 2011 and killed a number of persons, including a couple.

Our correspondent, who visited the market after the gun duel, reported that some courageous traders opened shops shortly after the incident. Customers, who visited the bank after the incident, were politely informed that operations had been suspended till today.

However, sanity eventually returned to the area before press time yesterday. The Police Area Commander, Mr. Hussaini Rabiu, confirmed the incident and hailed the policeman for repelling the suspects to gain access to the bank. Rabiu promised to track down the fleeing robbers, adding that detectives were on their trail"

A military task force stormed two buildings suspected of being Boko Haram safe houses in the Hotoro Dan Marke and Brigade areas of the city at around 3 a.m. (0200 GMT), where the battles occurred, an army statement said.

“Intelligence available indicates that the terrorists were in the process of finalising plans to carry out simultaneous suicide attacks in Abuja and Kano,” it added.

A Boko Haram suicide attack on the United Nations building two years ago in the capital Abuja killed at least 25 people.

The sect has killed thousands during its four-year insurgency and has become the biggest security threat in Africa’s top oil producer and second largest economy.

President Goodluck Jonathan stepped up a military campaign against the group’s northeastern heartland six months ago, with the result that much of the violence has moved into the countryside, where hundreds of civilians have been killed.

Saturday’s violence is a reminder that Boko Haram still poses a threat in Nigeria’s second largest city, which is more significant to the economy than the remote northeast is.

The last known violence linked to Boko Haram in Kano was a bomb blast in a Christian area in July that killed at least 15.

Jonathan declared a six-month state of emergency in May in the three northeastern states worst hit by Boko Haram, and this week asked the national assembly to extend it for a further six months.

Boko Haram wants to carve out an Islamic state in a country split roughly equally between Christians and Muslims. Since starting its uprising in 2009, the sect has turned itself from a clerical movement opposed to Western culture into an armed militia with links to al Qaeda’s West African wing. (Reuters)"

Forty houses were also said to have been torched in the villages.

It was gathered that the attacks, which began on Sunday night and had not ceased by Wednesday night, affected villages in Southern Borno which were once serene. The affected villages include Bdagu, Izge, Hartsa and Yazza in Gwoza, Damboa and Askira-Uba Local Government Areas of the state.

It was also learnt that the insurgents also recorded casualties as three of them were said to have been killed when people from the neighbouring villages of Dille and Lassa mobilised and pursued them in a counter-attack.

The villagers were said to have after killing the three insurgents, pursued the rest of the hoodlums into nearby bushes in the area.

It was gathered from a source in Bdagu community that the attackers between Monday and Wednesday, stormed the affected villages using two Hilux vehicles, three buses and over 30 motorcycles, and were armed with AK47 rifles. They went from house to house, killing, looting and setting houses ablaze.

The source revealed that in the Bdagu night attack alone, over 40 residential houses were burnt down by the sect members, including some farmlands in the area.

Another source from Yazza village told journalists that it was unfortunate that the attackers operated with impunity, ""without any challenge as we the villagers were unarmed and helpless.

""We want to use this medium to appeal to the state government and the General Officer commanding the newly established 7 Division, Nigerian Army, Major General Obidah Ethan, to immediately deploy military troops to the area, as we are now living in constant fear of more attacks.""

But while MASSOB claimed that the clash was an attack on its members because of the decision of the group to withdraw their support for the All Progressives Grand Alliance, the police declined comments on the incident. The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Emeka Chukwuemeka, said he had not been officially briefed.

Director of Information of MASSOB, Mr. Uchenna Madu, who said he was speaking on behalf of the leader of MASSOB, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, said the incident occurred in the early hours of the day and that the security team, made up of army, police and State Security Services personnel, stormed the MASSOB headquarters along Onitsha-Owerri Road and allegedly opened fire on the members.

He said that at the end of the attack, four persons were felled while about 80 persons were injured. He said those injured during the incident were denied medical attention because they could not produce police medical permit.

Madu also said that about 18 vehicles belonging to MASSOB members and traders at the Mgbuka-Obosi, Old Motor Spare Parts Obosi, and 137 motorcycles belonging to MASSOB members were burnt and cash sum of N920, 000 was taken by the security agents.

The MASSOB spokesman also said 37 traders in the Old Motor Spare Parts, Mgbuka, sustained bullet wounds and were rushed to various hospitals for medical attention.

He alleged that the clampdown on their members was masterminded by the state government which he accused of not being comfortable with members of the group’s resolve to announce their preferred candidate ahead of Saturday governorship election.

Madu said, “This devilish act of cowardice meted on MASSOB was not unconnected with our refusal to allow our name to be used by some desperate politicians who wanted to score cheap political goal, using our platform.

“We had issued a statement distancing ourselves from supporting APGA and its candidate ahead of the governorship election in the state. We are very quite aware that the stand we took did not go down well with some highly placed persons in the state, hence, the attack was to disorganise us and browbeat us to submission.

“We hold Peter Obi responsible for the killings. This reminds us about the 2006 shoot-on-sight order by Governor Peter Obi who massacred about 2,000 MASSOB members.

“We shall arrest him and pay him back in his own coin in our own way immediately he steps down as the governor because his recent action of killing MASSOB members will heavily affect APGA chances of winning this election.”

The Senior Special Assistant to Obi on Media and Publicity, Mr. Valentine Obienyem, who said he was not yet aware of the incident, wondered why MASSOB was attributing it to the governor.

“Why are they calling the name of the governor?” he asked.

A raid late on Friday targeted a Boko Haram base in the town of Bita in the Gwoza hills along the Cameroonian border, where the Islamists have set up camp after being pushed out of semi-desert areas further north.

""During the encounter 20 Boko Haram terrorists were killed, scores of vehicles and 50 motorcycles were destroyed. A soldier was killed and three other soldiers were wounded in the operation,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Dole, a spokesman for Nigerian forces in the north-eastern state of Borno. ""We are closing in on the insurgents.""



In a separate shootout on Thursday in the Damboa region of the same state the military said it had killed nine militants.

On Thursday gunmen kidnapped a French priest working in northern Cameroon in an area where Boko Haram is known to operate. No one has yet claimed responsibility.



The United States on Wednesday formally designated Boko Haram and the splinter group Ansaru as foreign terrorists, making it a crime to materially aid them.



Since May when Jonathan declared a state of emergency in north-east Nigeria, deploying extra troops to try to flush Boko Haram out, there has been a surge in attacks on civilians, with hundreds killed in recent weeks.



Rights groups such as Amnesty International say hundreds of Boko Haram suspects have died in military captivity. Nigeria's military denies abusing captives.

Boko Haram has killed thousands during its struggle to try to impose sharia or Islamic law on religiously mixed Nigeria.

1695,Vigilantes torture man,11/15/2013,Ejilewe Ukwuagba Ngbo,,Ebonyi,1,,,Sectarian Actor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Other,,http://sunnewsonline.com/new/national/man-38-tortured-death/,,,,,", Ebonyi, Nigeria",Nigeria,"…By vigilantes his mum invited over her missing cellphones

By Ngozi UwujareA 55-year-old mother in Ejilewe Ukwuagba Ngbo community, Ebonyi State, Mrs. Alice Nwakpu is now beset by deep regret for handing over her son to a vigilance group in their community on the suspicion that he stole her two cellphones.

Rather than recover the phones, she got a dead son back: the young man was virtually tortured to death by the ‘do-good’ vigilante members.

According to Mrs. Nwakpu, she had only wanted the leaders of the Ejilewe Ukwuagba Neighbourhood Security Committee to punish her son, Ome Nwakpu, 38, she alleged had stolen her phones, but the group of vigilantes went beyond their brief.

Narrating the unfortunate incident, which he described as “terrible and ugly,” the Commissioner of Police, Ebonyi State Police Command, Mr. Maigari Dikko told Sunday Sun that the vigilante tied Ome with a rope and tortured him for about 12 hours, apparently to extract a confession from him.

The ugly cycle of events that led to Ome’s untimely death began when his mother noticed that her phones had ‘developed wings’ and she accused him of stealing them. Probably not convinced with his denials, she reported the matter to one Dennis Eze, leader of the vigilance group.

Eze called some members of the group on phone and Ome was promptly arrested at about 6.00am and taken to their operational base for interrogation. They tied his hands with a rope and at some point in the course of the interrogation began to torture him.

Later that day, at 6.00pm, Ome was released to his mother. By then he was in great pain and could not walk well. Two days later he died.

CP Dikko disclosed that it was one Omeh Elijah, a lawyer,who reported the death of the victim to the police at Ohaukwu Police Station, stating that the young man died as a result of the torture meted out to him by the Ejilewe vigilance group.

Upon receiving the report, the police moved and quickly rounded up the alleged culprits, namely, Dennis Eze, 38; Emeka Eze, 25; Amo Eke, 55 and Onwe Edwin, 37.

Lamenting over her monumental error, Ome’s mother told Sunday Sun: “I have regretted what I have done. It was me that said my son, Ome Nwakpu stole my two phones and I reported him to the head of the vigilance group, Dennis Eze. They tied him with ropes and they tortured him.”

She explained further: “I bought a carton of beer and a bottle of hot drink for the vigilantes for a job well done. But later I saw that my son was weak and couldn’t walk properly. Two days later he died. I want my son to forgive me. I thought they would help me to warn him but I didn’t send them to beat him to death. I have explained to the entire family. This is beyond what I can explain, only God can deliver me from this predicament.”

Ome’s mother’s regret is now cold comfort to him as his body lies in the mortuary of Comprehensive Hospital, Ngbo, where it was deposited.

CP Dikko revealed that an autopsy conducted on the victim’s body to determine the cause of death found that Ome died of internal hemorrhage as a result of severe head and soft tissue injuries. He said that the suspects would soon be charged to court."

A raid late on Friday targeted a Boko Haram base in the town of Bita in the Gwoza hills along the Cameroonian border, where the Islamists have set up camp after being pushed out of semi-desert areas further north.

""During the encounter 20 Boko Haram terrorists were killed, scores of vehicles and 50 motorcycles were destroyed. A soldier was killed and three other soldiers were wounded in the operation,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Dole, a spokesman for Nigerian forces in the north-eastern state of Borno. ""We are closing in on the insurgents.""



In a separate shootout on Thursday in the Damboa region of the same state the military said it had killed nine militants.

On Thursday gunmen kidnapped a French priest working in northern Cameroon in an area where Boko Haram is known to operate. No one has yet claimed responsibility.



The United States on Wednesday formally designated Boko Haram and the splinter group Ansaru as foreign terrorists, making it a crime to materially aid them.



Since May when Jonathan declared a state of emergency in north-east Nigeria, deploying extra troops to try to flush Boko Haram out, there has been a surge in attacks on civilians, with hundreds killed in recent weeks.



Rights groups such as Amnesty International say hundreds of Boko Haram suspects have died in military captivity. Nigeria's military denies abusing captives.

Boko Haram has killed thousands during its struggle to try to impose sharia or Islamic law on religiously mixed Nigeria. It is seen as the main security threat to Africa's top energy producer and western powers fear that it could export militancy as it expands its ties with Islamists linked to al-Qaida."

Two police officers lost their lives in the shootout while three of the suspected robbers were killed. Some policemen were equally injured while many members of the armed robbery gang escaped with bullet wounds.

However, operatives of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS who were immediately drafted to the scene of the robbery succeeded in arresting four members of the gang.

It was gathered that the robbers engaged officers from Ayobo Police Division and SARS operatives in serious gun battle for over 30 minutes, creating fear in the area.

The robbers had reportedly forced their way into the bank and were vandalising the Automated Teller Machines in the bank, when policemen from Ayobo Police Division raced to the scene.

The armed robbers were said to have initially overpowered the police team, after a fierce gun duel and were about escaping from the scene of the robbery when another round of gun duel ensued between them and SARS operatives.

At the end of the ferocious gun battles, four members of the gang were arrested but the gang leader and some of the robbers escaped with bullet wounds.

A resident at Ayobo who spoke with Community Mirror said her experience was scary, saying “considering the magnitude and heavy shooting that characterised the robbery, the entire place was like war zone. The shootings were so sophisticated and scary.”

Confirming the incident; Police Public Relations Officer for Lagos State Police Command, Ngozi Braide said it was a foiled robbery attempt on a branch of Access Bank.

According to her; “at about 0200 hours, Ayobo Division received a distress call that armed robbers were trying to break Access Bank ATM in the area and patrol team led by ASP Longnus Amuzie, responded swiftly.

“The robbers on sighting the patrol vehicle opened fire, while the police responded and engaged them squarely in a fierce gun duel. Sadly two of our officers lost their lives, while the attempted robbery was forestalled.”

“During this encounter, men of SARS were drafted to the scene and four of the robbers were apprehended as they were fleeing from the area. They are currently undergoing interrogation and assisting the police in investigation.”"

Idowu Peters, who is from Edo State, had connived with Segun Babalola and another man, who is at large, to rob a house on Rafiu Adetola Street, Aromolaran in Agugu area of Ibadan on November 8. They reportedly succeeded in stealing a laptop, mobile telephones and jewellery from their victims at gun point. Trouble however started for Peters, who, in an attempt to escape was shot in his lap with the locally-made berretta pistol used in the robbery after it accidentally fired.

He was said to have been abandoned by his accomplices, who also took the gun from him. According to the state Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Ndabawa, Segun showed no remorse as he attempted to use the same gun to rob a motorcyclist along Sawmill area of Ibadan.

He said, “He was caught while trying to rob a motorcyclist two days after he escaped from a robbery scene in Ibadan. We are looking for the third gang member.”

Peters told our correspondent that he was arrested when a policeman saw him in a pool of his own blood, adding that he bought the gun for the purpose of the robbery.

“While trying to escape the robbery scene, the gun I was holding went off and blasted through my lap. I fell and waited until the following morning in a bush.

A highly placed military source, who disclosed this to one of our correspondents on Wednesday in Abuja, described the raid as a major victory against the insurgents.

It was learnt that the raid, which began on Saturday, consisted of both attack by land troops and aerial bombardment by the air force.

The raid was said to have been made possible as a result of intelligence reports and air reconnaissance operations in the area.

The source described Yaurakura as a major stronghold of the insurgents and that the area also served as an escape route on water.

The source said that the troops also seized several arms and ammunition from the Boko Haram fighters.

Among the items said to have been seized from the insurgents were sub- machine guns, BMG machine guns, rifles, rocket propelled bombs and assorted ammunitions as well as four vehicles said to be laden with Improvise Explosive Devices.

The source said, “The troops captured a stronghold of the terrorists at Yaurakura, Bagudu Island of Lake Chad and about 20 of them were killed while many were wounded.

“The arms seized from them include sub machine guns, rifles, rocket propelled bombs, assorted ammunitions, five speed boats, a welding machine and four vehicles. The vehicles were loaded with IEDS.”

Director of Defence Information, Brig. Gen Chris Olukolade, said that the Special Forces would continue the raids on the camps of the insurgents and would not allow them operate any base in and around the country.

He said that the main focus of the ongoing military raids was to ensure that the insurgents were prevented from establishing or reactivating any camp in the country.

“The onslaught against the terrorists is continuing in every direction, they will not be allowed to operate any base in Nigeria,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria on Wednesday raised the alarm over the continued killing of Christians in the north by members of the Boko Haram Islamic sect.

The association in a communiqué issued at the end of its Special Meeting in Abuja and signed by its General Secretary, Dr. Musa Asake, expressed worries that despite the state of emergency declared in the North-Eastern part of the country to curtail insurgency, the attacks on Christians had continued unabated.

The communique reads in part, “On the 3rd of this month at about 8pm, Boko Haram members attacked Ngoshe village in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State and killed eight Christians: Baba Ayuba, Baba Bitrus and Baba Isa Biyabra, the security guard and four others whose names we are yet to get.

“They burnt 11 houses owned by the Christians and three churches: EYN church, Deeper Life Bible Church and the Redeemed Christian Church of God. We were informed that when the Christian community sought to meet the state governor on this issue, he said he does not have the time to see them until February next year.”

1707,Monarch Strangled,11/20/2013,Ilashe Ijesa,Obokun,Osun,1,,,Sectarian Actor,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/osun-monarch-strangled-before-inferno-residents/,,,,,"Obokun, Osun, Nigeria",Nigeria,"Some chiefs and residents of Ilashe Ijesa in Obokun Local Government Area of Osun State on Thursday narrated how the monach of the town, Oba Adesina Anibijuwon, was killed by suspected members of Odua People’s Congress, who allegedly strangled him and left his corpse inside his residence which they set ablaze.

Those who recovered his corpse from the building said the charred remains of Anibijuwon were taken to the mortuary at Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Teaching Hospital in Osogbo by Osun Ambulance Service at around 10.30pm on Wednesday.

The ambulance that conveyed the remains of the monarch was said to have been escorted to the mortuary by armed policemen and some residents. The residents feared that those who killed him might want to seize his corpse.

Some residents who also spoke with our correspondent said the officials of the state fire service, who came to put out the inferno, ran out of water.

Some residents wondered why some chiefs in the town went into hiding when the hoodlums invaded the palace, urging the police to interrogate them to see if they were culpable.

The Commissioner for Information, Mr. Sunday Akere; his counterpart at the Ministry of Home, Culture and Tourism, Mr. Sikiru Ayedun; and the Special Adviser on Security, Mr. Amos Adekunle, who visited the town expressed shock on seeing the extent of damage done to the residence of the traditional ruler.

Our correspondent, who also visited the town, observed that the upper floor of the two-storey building where the monarch resided was completely razed.

One of the chiefs, Adejumo Operinmade, told PUNCH Metro that he was informed that some persons, who claimed to be OPC members, came and demanded to see the monarch, but they were told that he was asleep.

He stated that the strange visitors came back and they pointed a gun to the head of the monarch’s housemaid. They allegedly went to late Anibijuwon’s room and strangled the octogenarian monarch who had been blind for over nine years.

Operinmade said, “We were told that some gunmen who claimed to be OPC members came and wanted to see Kabiyesi but they were told that he was sleeping.

“They came back and held the housemaid living with Kabiyesi hostage and went to where Kabiyesi was sleeping. But immediately they came out, fire started and Kabiyesi was burnt inside the house. His corpse was taken to the mortuary at LAUTECH.”

The Sasore of Ilase, Chief Oluwagbemiga Oke, said there was no land dispute or chieftaincy tussle in the town, wondering why the suspected arsonists killed the monarch.

Chief Jumoke Ogunkeyede, whose brother gave the burnt residence to the monarch, also said he heard that the hoodlums, who perpetrated the act, had an accident at the outskirts of the town while escaping from the scene.

He said, “We heard that they came in a red Mazda 323 and their car veered off into the bush while they were speeding away. We called journalists from Osun State Broadcasting Corporation at Ibokun, but when they got there to take photographs of the car, they saw that the it had been set ablaze.

“They also removed the number plate of the car. I believe that they set the car ablaze to hide their identities. But the police could still find a way of unraveling those behind the killing and arson.”

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mrs. Folasade Odoro, told our correspondent on the telephone that the command had commenced investigation into the matter.

She said, “We are pleading with members of the public to always furnish police with information any time they suspect strange persons and movement in their areas. This will assist the police to prevent crimes.”

Agudama-Epie is the host to the South-South Campus of the Nigerian Law School and Central Naval Command of the Nigerian Navy.

Sources said the two communities were fighting over a disputed farmland behind the Law School.

Both communities are located on the outskirts of Yenagoa, the state capital.

The five victims, said to be indigenes of Aguama-Epie, were killed on the disputed land in the early hours of Friday.

It was learnt that attackers from both communities were armed with dangerous weapons such as guns and machetes.

One of the corpses of the victims was said to have been recovered while four were still being searched for as of press time.

It was further learnt that the land had been a source of dispute for many years with occasional threats by both communities.

But Friday’s clash, it was gathered, was triggered by the presence of some members of a committee set up to resolve the dispute on the disputed land.

“The fight is caused by a land dispute. It has been there. They set up a committee to resolve the issue. The committee went to the land. Their presence triggered the fight,” a security source said."

But that was the case a couple of weeks ago in Ilaro, Ogun State

An auto mechanic, Taofeek Olabisi, is currently on the run after allegedly stabbing his bosom friend to death. Taofeek, a father of two, was said to have engaged his friend in a fight recently at his workshop situated around Ajegunle community, along Ilaro Express Way in Ogun State.

Taofeek and his friend, Mojeed, both grew up under the same roof at Papalanto area of the state but they parted ways when the latter’s parents died and he had to go and live with his uncle in Lagos in 2008. After a brief spell in Lagos, Mojeed returned to his root where he decided to hook up with Taofeek, his bosom friend again.

When Mojeed moved back to the village, he had nothing doing for a living but was reportedly offered a space beside his friend’s workshop where he began to trade in retail sale of engine oil and similar products. The friendship of the two men continued ever since until recently when things turned sour.

On Thursday, November 14, 2013, a misunderstanding ensued between the two friends. At the end of the day Mojeed died; allegedly stabbed to death by Taofeek. Long before then, Taofeek had repeatedly told his friend to commence payment on the portion of the land he was occupying.

Anytime Taofeek reportedly raised the issue, Mojeed would express his willingness to pay for the space he was occupying but begged to be allowed until the end of the year.

An eyewitness told reporters that on the fateful day, Taofeek, who had gone for a union meeting at Ilaro, returned to ask his friend’s sales boy not to open the kiosk where they displayed their wares. Mojeed, at the time, was said to be away in Lagos. Mojeed’s apprentice quickly called his boss, narrating to him Taofeek’s action.

Apparently piqued by the report, Mojeed abandoned his Lagos trip and headed back to base. A neighbour of the two friends, who does not want his name in prints, told Saturday Mirror on telephone that when Mojeed attempted to confront his friend with the allegation, the latter took offence and fighting ensued. “It all started like a joke even though we all had, at one time or another had cause to settle quarrel for them over the issue.

But on that day, Mojeed did not come to shop directly but asked his boy to open the shop while he went to Lagos. When Tao came to shop and saw that his friend’s shop was opened, he called out the boy and asked him to lock up the shop. “I think the boy now called his Oga (Mojeed) on phone to inform him of the development.

Before long, Mojeed came back from where he went to and confronted Tao on the issue. I was attending to a customer at the time when suddenly I heard a loud noise and shout from their shops.

Thinking they were just arguing among themselves, I did not immediately give heed to the noise, until the boy ran out of the shop to say Tao had stabbed his Oga with a tool,” the neighbour said. It was reported that the argument escalated into brawl when Mojeed threatened to make the matter a police issue.

As the fight between the two friends became inflamed, none of the shop owners nearby came to separate them until Taofeek allegedly stabbed his friend on the chest. Mojeed reportedly collapsed on a small sofa in his friend’s shop where the fight started from.

Another neighbour, who also would not want his name in print, explained the last moments of Mojeed. According to the source, “I was just coming from my house that day when I saw a crowd gathered at the entrance of Tao’s shop.

I was afraid and I had to rush down to the shop leaving all I had on me by the roadside. When I got there, I met Mojeed on the floor with blood gushing out of his chest. His shirt was drenched with his blood.

The next thing was to find a way of saving his life. This same Tao and another person picked on a pick-up van in the workshop saying they wanted to get fuel into it at a filling station nearby.

But we were all surprised when we saw the second man returned about half an hour later without Tao. When we asked him, he told us that Tao asked him to pick a keg at another friend’s shop along the expressway and before the man returned, he had fled with the vehicle,” he said.

Speaking with reporters, Mojeed’s apprentice, Juibirila, maintained that his boss did not inflict any injury on his friend, but that Taofeek was the one that grabbed the work tool and stabbed Mojeed with it.

According to Jubirila, who spoke through one of his elder brothers, “When I resumed that morning to open the shop and Oga Tao asked me to close it, I called my Oga on the phone and he told me not to open it that he would be on his way to the shop immediately. By the time my Oga returned, he went straight into his friend office and there was a heated argument.

It was suddenly I noticed that the two of them were fighting and I had to scream to draw attention to the scene. But before people would come, Oga Tao had stabbed my Oga and the cut was severe indeed,” Jubirila said. All attempts to speak with Taofeek were futile as his two mobile phones were switched off."

Many buyers and sellers were also injured on Thursday when the attackers unleashed terror at the Kasuwar Gwari Market along Mubi By-pass in the northern state, said Shehu Abdul, a trader who witnessed the incident.

The eyewitness said there was serious stampede at the market as the gunmen shot victims at very close range.

""There was sporadic shooting and everyone ran for his life. As of Friday morning, we counted up to six lifeless bodies,"" Abdul said in Yola, capital of the state.

Major markets in the area and Yola were not open on Friday due to a manhunt launched against the gunmen by security operatives, other sources said.

Fatai Alli, the army commander in charge of Yola and its environs, declined to speak when reporters sought his comment on the incident on Friday afternoon.

It was not clear whether the Boko Haram sect, which has posed as the biggest security threat in the northern part of Nigeria, was responsible for the attack.

The sect had coordinated many violent attacks in Adamawa and other states in the volatile northeastern region of the West African country in the past.

A state of emergency declared in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states by President Goodluck Jonathan was extended last week by another six months following unending activities of Boko Haram insurgents in the region.

Thousands of people have been killed since the sect launched its insurgency in 2009. It seeks to enshrine the Islamic sharia law into the constitution and declares war against the Western education."

The eldest son of the late politician, Mr. Sonny Harry, who disclosed this to SUNDAY PUNCH on Friday, said his sister was seized by hoodlums on December 1, 2013, about 100 metres away from her residence in Eleparanwo, Rivers State.

He said his sister’s Honda CRV jeep, taken away by the kidnappers, was recovered the following day at Rumumasi in Port Harcourt.

Harry, who was visibly worried about the whereabouts of 30-year-old Miss Julie, stated that he had yet to establish contact with the kidnappers of his sister, five days after her abduction.

“I reported the matter to the police, the State Security Service, other relevant security agents and they all said they had begun investigations. We do not see the kidnap of our sister as politically motivated.

“Her kidnap is one of the indications of the increasing level of insecurity in the state. When she was kidnapped, we decided to wait with the hope that she would soon be released.

“But as I speak with you, she has not regained her freedom and we have yet to establish contact with those who kidnapped her.

“Since her abduction, no contact has been made with her family and no ransom has been demanded. The family has also reported this incident to the security agencies,” the senior Harry added.

He, appealed to Julie’s captors to release her and save the family more psychological trauma after the gruesome murder of their father.

Confirming the incident, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, said security agents had since swung into action to ensure the rescue of the kidnap victim.

He stated out that the police would leave no stone unturned in its bid to rescue the victim.

The bus driver, Sada Muhammad, who hailed from Dankyandi village in Malumfashi Local Government area of the state, was conveying some passengers at about 10pm when the incident occurred.

One of the passengers who spoke to journalists yesterday on condition of anonymity, said the driver rammed into the armed robbers minutes after leaving one of the motor parks in Kano State.

He said the armed robbers did not erect any road block but that some of them were flashing their flashlight when the bus got to the spot.

The passenger said: “The driver was speeding at the time he got to the spot where the robbers were operating and that one of them, who was standing on the middle of the road, was knocked down in the process. “The action angered the robbers and one of them, who was standing some few meters away, fired at the direction of the driver.

“The impact made the driver to slow down a bit as he had been hit by bul-lets. The rest of the robbers then rushed to the car and riddled the driver’s body with bullets.”

He, however, said the armed robbers did not harm any of the passengers and that they did not take any of their belongings.

Attempts to speak with the Katsina State Police Command spokesman, Aminu Abubakar, on the incident failed as he did not respond to repeated calls to his mobile telephones."

The Medical Director of Sterling Specialist Hospital in Borokiri, Rivers State, Dr. Kennedy Nyendike, has been kidnapped by gunmen. Two of his staff, a medical doctor, whose name could not be ascertained as at press time, and a receptionist, were shot during the operation, which lasted about six minutes.

The doctor was shot in the stomach while the receptionist was shot in one of her legs. Daily Sun gathered that the doctor is now in critical condition at the Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH).

Daily Sun checks revealed that the kidnappers stormed the hospital, a two-storey building, at about 8:30 on Sunday and ordered the patients and staffers to lie down, as they shot sporadically into the air and ransacked all the rooms in search of the medical director.

On arrival, they rushed to the first floor of the building, on the assumption that the medical director was there, but when they could not find him, they marched the receptionist to the ground floor and ordered her to show them where her boss was.

The frightened lady, took them to the consulting room, where Dr. Nyendike was, and they shot one of the doctors with him in the consulting room, before taking away the medical director in his vehicle.

The abductors later abandoned the vehicle at the Tourists Beach, Borokiri, and moved their victim into a waiting boat and sped off to an unknown destination.

According to a source, not even the sounds of gun shots could attract policemen to the scene. The same source disclosed that it was after the kidnappers had left the hospital that policemen arrived the scene to pick expended bullets and left.

However, it was the police that saw where Dr Nyendike’s vehicle was abandoned.

An eyewitness, who is also close to the medical director’s family, said the victim’s whereabouts remained unknown, saying his abductors had not demanded any ransom.

When contacted, the Rivers State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Muhammad, told Daily Sun that the police were intensifying efforts to rescue the victim."

Monday ambush was on the volatile Maiduguri-Damboa- Biu road, which had witnessed series of highway raids while scores of people had been killed by the outlawed sect.

It was gathered that the latest attack occurred few kilometres away from Limanti/ Bullabulin Ngarwa communities, where series of deadly road attacks, masterminded by the Boko Haram sect, had taken place in recent times.

Speaking to journalists in Maiduguri, a commercial driver, mallam Musa Usman, who narrowly escaped been caught up in the attack, said the sect took to the highway at about 9am.

He said some suspected members of the notorious sect were seen driving from their haven in the Sambisa Game Forest unto the highway and on getting to the highway barricaded other vehicles, “They set ablaze three vehicles including a truck loaded with oranges.”

Usman added that immediately he got to the scene, few minutes after the attack, he saw the terrorists forcefully ordering the abducted drivers into their vehicles.

This was even as the military authorities in the area alleged that the sect have resorted to forcefully conscripting young people into their fold, following the deadly attacks by troops in the last few days at the Sambisa Forest and other camps, where members of the sects lost hundreds of their fighters.

Spokesman of the 7 Division, Nigerian Army, Col Muhammadu Dole, in a chat with journalists in Maiduguri said the terrorists are now moving around villages and other highways to abduct and forcefully recruit innocent people to replace their falling heroes, who were killed by the troops.

“You know they have suffered serious defeat in the last few days, now they are forcefully recruiting men and women, the women were taken along with them, cooking and serving them food.

“We are on their trail and we would continue to pursue them to the last person. I want to urge members of the general public to continue to cooperate with the security agencies, particularly on information gathering that will expose Boko Haram’s hideouts in the state.

“We are aware that, most of those they abducted on the highways of Maiduguri- Damboa Road, among others, a couple of days ago, are still in their custody as they did not kill them, rather, they forced them to go away with them into the bushes of the Sambisa Game Forests.

“They recruit them forcefully and we are working towards ensuring the safety of those abducted in all the operation we are carrying out.” Dole said.

Traders at ‘Kasuwan doya’ and ‘Tashan Kano Motor Park’ in Maiduguri metropolis said that nine female traders and 27 other young men, were abducted last Monday, when the insurgents ambushed two trucks conveying bags of oranges from Benue State, about 56 kilometres away from Maiduguri the state capital.

A pick up van carrying firewood and a gulf car carrying six passengers were all burnt at the spot after abducting the occupants.

According to some of the traders at Tashan Kano Motor Park, the two lorries left them at Damboa town at about 7.00am heading for Maiduguri.

Meanwhile, the Borno State Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Services (NIS), Modu Musa Miringa, has alleged the presence of Boko Haram insurgents in most of the border communities in the area.

Miringa said he was able to observe the presence of the terrorists during his tour of border communities recently.

He called on the state government to, as a matter of urgency; prevail on the security on the need to rid the border communities of bad elements in the villages along the border towns.

In another development, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Pastor Ayo of Oritsejafor yesterday came down hard on the Islamic sect, Boko Haram, saying the group “is a disgrace to the African continent.

This was even as the CAN President donated N2 million to the Tarayyah Masihiyawan Nijeriya, which English version reads, Hausa, Fulani, Kanuri Christian Association of Nigeria.

He stated that “at the right time, God will disgrace and expose the sponsors of this terror being unleashed on Nigerians.”

Oritsejafor was responding to some of the weighty issues raised by General Ahmed Dikko (rtd), leader of a delegation of Kanuri- Fulani Christians, predominantly from core northern states who paid him a solidarity visit.

According to him; “Boko Haram started as a group with the aim to Islamize Nigeria. They have caused a lot of damage. It is a disgrace to the entire African continent and at the right time, God will expose the sponsors of this group.”"

Our Correspondent gathered that the incident took place at about 8 am on Thursday when some members of a terrorists group who were trying to cross the road from their camps/ hideouts in the Sambisa Forest clashed with military troops which led to the exchange of gunfire.

The situation led to the death of three terrorists at the spot, subsequently, those who fled through the riverine areas were later killed by aerial bombardment.

Sources said during the encounter with the military troops, all roads leading to the area were closed for over three hours in order to avoid civilian casualties, particularly motorists and their passengers who were plying the road as at the time of the air strikes.

A commercial driver, Ali Wando, who came from Gwoza into Maiduguri told our correspondent, “I saw three corpses by the roadside at Ngauramari which were dismembered by the rocket launcher fired at them by the military when they came on their tricycle.

“Several other bodies were lying further in the bush but I did not go to count the bodies because I was afraid as I believed some of the insurgents might be hiding in the bush”.

Another commercial driver who did not want his name mentioned in print for security reason said, “ soon after the military killed the terrorists in Ngauramari, the Nigerian Airforce fighter jet located more suspected terrorists around the Bama-Firgi -Gwoza river bank attempting to cross the river before the airforce fighter jet dropped some bombs on them killing many of them”.

After the operation, the gun-wielding hoodlums were said to have shot into the air to scare he people away before escaping through the Ikere-Ogotun road.

Our correspondent gathered that motorists from Ado Ekiti, the state capital, were taking a detour to escape being hit by stray bullets during the operation.

Those within the vicinity of the bank and residents of Ikere were said to have fled during the gun duel between the police and the hoodlums.

Members of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in the state were reportedly booed by the aggrieved residents in protest against the police late arrival.

A resident, who craved anonymity, said, “Around 4am on Sunday, there was a party in Dele Hotel in the area and many guys came to the area to have fun. However, some guys from Ijora-Badia clashed with some other guys along the railway line.

“Policemen immediately rushed down to the scene and started shooting indiscriminately. In the process, one Moses Ayenuro was hit in the neck while another guy was also shot. He later died in the hospital.”

It was learnt that the mother of one of the slain boys mobilised women and other residents to the station to demand justice, only for the policemen on duty to disperse them with live bullets.

It was learnt that after dispersing the youths, the policemen embarked on a raid and arrested many other youths.

However, a senior officer at the station, who craved anonymity, said only one youth was killed adding that he was killed by hoodlums and not policemen.

He said, “When we got to the scene, many of the youths were seen stabbing one another with machetes and broken bottles and we shot into the air to disperse them. After the pandemonium, we observed that one of the boys had been stabbed in the neck.

“We were therefore surprised when residents began protesting later in the day. They became violent and started throwing bottles and stones at our station and we had no choice but to disperse them.”

Police Public Relations Officer, Ngozi Braide, said five suspects had been arrested. She maintained that police did not kill anyone. She said, rather, it was the hoodlums that killed Ayenuro.

Moses Ayeneru was stabbed, but he was rescued along with one IK and another guy but Ayeneru died at hospital. The hoodlums attacked the station, demanding the release of their men.

Minimah said immediately the bunkers saw the army team led by Capt. I. Amaya, they abandoned the vehicle loaded with over 66, 000 litres of crude oil and took to their heels, but that in an attempt to arrest them, one of the hoodlums was shot dead.

According to him, “the incident happened around 1:30am at Owazza in Ukwa west local government. The bunkers, including the driver of the truck and the conductor with other accomplices on sighting my men, dashed into the nearby bush and in an attempt to arrest them, one of the hoodlums was shot dead.

“What you are seeing today is one of the successes of the military in Aba and indeed, Abia State. We got an intelligence report that some people would come at the wee hours of the night to vandalise pipelines and scoop petroleum products. We step up our surveillance and today, it has really paid off.

“We are not going to rest on our oars. We are committed to not only secure the properties of governments, but also protect lives and property in the state.

“This is not the first time we doing this, it is the 5th or 6th . This should also serve as a warning to those who are head bent in siphoning government. We have intensified our patrol on the pipeline and will continue to make sure that we not only discourage people from pipeline vandalism, but also make sure that their illegal business never thrives”, he assured."

Six of the suspected kidnappers were arrested, while a cache of arms, including three Pump Action guns were recovered from the bandits.

The incident it was learnt occurred around the university town of Ugbowo, after a 70 year-old man who was said to have gone out jogging was abducted by the suspects.

The victim it was learnt was forced inside the boot of an Audi car and driven off to the kidnappers’ hideout where they met their waterloo, as the police came after them.

Edo State Police Commissioner, Foluso Adebanjo, while confirming the incident to our correspondent on the telephone, said it happened around at 6am, saying men from the command went to rescue the 70-year old, following a tip off on location of the kidnappers’ hideout.

He said, “Early this morning at about 6am, hoodlums came with an Audi vehicle and abducted this 70 years old man around Ugbowo. They put in him in the boot of the Audi and drove off.

“Information got to me, so I quickly directed our anti-kidnapping team to carry out a raid in that area. Our vehicle was parked far away from the hideout, so we trekked to the scene.

“One of them must have observed that it could be policemen, and shouted. So they started firing at us and we responded. Two of them were shot dead while six were arrested. None of our men sustained any injury and we thank God for that.”

“We observed that the old man was tortured when they were forcing him to inform them where to get ransom from. Like I said earlier, we will continue to go after them,” added the CP"

No fewer than eight people have been killed in a fresh attack on villages in the southern part of Borno State by suspected Boko Haram insurgents.

The attackers were also said to have burnt many churches

Residents said some suspected Boko Haram member attacked Sabon Gari village in Hambagtha and Jaji wards of Gwoza Local Government Area on Thursday, killing eight villagers while the attackers set ablaze about 100 churches in the area. The churches destroyed, according to witnesses are located in communities around the Nigerian-Cameroon border. These include Arbako, Barawa, Chikide, Ngoshe, Pulka, Kirawa, Kwatara, Hirdembeh, Chinene and Kundeh in Gwoza Local Government Area. Gwoza, a border town is about135 kilometres South-East of Maiduguri.

A member of the House of Representatives, Peter Biye Gumtha, representing Gwoza/Chibok/Damboa confirmed the incident, adding that the village attacks were launched by eight insurgents. He said eight people were killed while 16 others were injured.

“What is happening in my constituency is very unfortunate and frightening. People are being killed by terrorists on a daily basis, Churches are being burnt, and if people like me who is also a member of the House Committee on Army, alerted military authorities based on intelligence reports that my village would be under attack by terrorists, and nothing was done to secure the area, then it is unfortunate, because the ordinary people that live in volatile areas are no longer safe and protected by our security outfits.

“As I am talking to you now, I have spent over two years without going to see my people and the electorate because I am no longer safe. All my projects which were aimed at alleviating the economic hardship of my people have been destroyed. There was a time I sent my contractors to construct a health centre in Gwoza town, a day after, they commenced constructing the foundation, some Boko Haram elements went to the project site, destroyed and buried everything,” he stated.

He said apart from churches torched by the insurgents, many primary schools and other public buildings in his constituency, were also burnt.

“Even my countryhome, located on the Bama-Gwoza Road was torched in the early hours of last Thursday. The gunmen also took away over 70 sheep and goats, after destroying 90, 000 packets of chalk, pens and exercise books procured at N38 million for distribution to schools in my constituency,” he further said.

The lawmaker lamented that since he was elected there had been series of attacks targeted at Christian communities in Gwoza, Chibok and Damboa council areas, a situation that forced him to stop visiting the area."

The Edo police command has confirmed the arrest of nine persons following the fracas over the festival in which two youths were shot in Igarra community, Akoko-Edo local government area of the State. Confirming the arrest, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Foluso Adebanjo, said the suspects would be transferred to the state command, adding that the victims of the gun shots were responding to treatment.

He said the command would not tolerate people taking the laws into their hands, and that the suspects would be paraded before the media on Monday.

It was learnt that some youths allegedly loyal to the Otaru of Igarra, Emmanuel Adachie Saiki 11, ambushed some others and shot Majebir Oseni and Sule Kassim, in an attempt to enforce a ban of the Ekuochi masquerade festival.

The victims of the shooting are said to be receiving treatment at different private hospitals in Igarra, but the Otaru is blaming the police for the incident.

“I believe the incident could have been avoided but the police did not manage the situation well. If the police had responded promptly and did their job well, the crisis would not have happened.

“A councillor from ward 11 had informed me that some youths in the community were planning to go ahead with the Ekuochi festival banned since 1986 because of its attendant violence, the Divisional Police officer (DPO) allowed himself to be cajoled by one of the youths and lured police men away from the venue of the festival, hence the crisis which is an unfortunate incident. And I want to blame the police authority for the crisis,” the Otaru said.

Reacting to the claim by the Monarch, the Divisional Police Officer(DPO) in charge of Akoko-Edo, Hilary Edom, denied the allegation, saying that he promptly responded to the Otaru’s information by mobilising his men to the venue of the planned festival.

He explained that after a brief dialogue with the youths, and having identified one of their leaders, who pledged to make an undertaking that the festival would be violent-free, the police returned to the office for its documentation.

“It was while we were still in the process of documentation, that report reached me that some youths had laid ambush for unsuspecting youths shooting, two persons in the process.

“The venue of the shooting is different from the venue of the planned festival where my men were still stationed and it was because my men were still on ground that the situation did not escalate out of hand”, Edom said.

Meanwhile, High Chief Gabriel Ashipa, the Oshimdase of Igarra, who is Head of the Anonyete Clan, from whose house the shot victims belong, denied that the festival had been banned.

Threatening a reprisal action should the concerned authority, especially the state government refuse to promptly act, Ashipa said the incident was a repeat of what happened in 2012 during the community’s age group festival."

HOODLUMS suspected to be militants on Sunday invaded the Save Rivers Movement rally in Bori, Khana Local Government Area and unleashed terror on members of the group.

The militants, who wore masks were said to have shot sporadically mostly at vehicles parked at the venue of the event by state government officials.

The Secretary to the State Government, Mr. George Feyii, the Chief of Staff, Government House, Chief Tony Okocha, and some journalists were among those that escaped death by a whisker.

Some however sustained serious bullet injuries during the incident that occurred barely a week after a similar rally was disrupted by operatives of the Rivers State Police Command in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area.

Okocha was also lucky during the Obio Akpor rally but a pro-Rotimi Amaechi senator, Magnus Abe, was not as he was shot with rubber bullets by policemen. Abe is currently in a London hospital receiving treatment.

It was learnt that during the latest incident, the militants, who besieged the All Saints Anglican Church venue of the rally, had begun shooting within Bori around 4.30am on Sunday.

They (hoodlums) however marched to the open field and fired at the parked vehicles at about 10. 40am, forcing the SRM members to flee.

The first group of militants arrived wielding cutlasses while the second group came in later, wearing masks and shooting intermittently with sophisticated weapons.

However, the absence of security operatives at the venue made the attackers to have a field day.

Channels Television crew members that were on the ground to cover the event had the windscreen of their Outside Broadcasting Van smashed.

The SSG’s bullet-riddled Brilliance saloon car was seen being driven out of the venue of the rally.

A government official said they had to run into the bush when they saw a group of masked militants arriving the venue.

He said, “Immediately they came close, they started shooting at some of our vehicles. Some of us would have died if we had not taken the decision to run into the bush.”

Okocha told journalists that his personal security aides and those of the SGS rescued them.

Channel’s reporter, Grace Ekang, said she was “traumatised by the incident.”

“They (hoodlums) were shooting seriously; they attacked us and the first group that came stole our big camera,” Ekang lamented.

At Bori, policemen mounted roadblocks and barred journalists from gaining entry into the scene of the incident while motorists were forced to take longer routes to their destinations.

Governor Amaechi, who later inspected some of the damaged government and Channels Television vehicles, lamented the security situation in the state and described President Goodluck Jonathan’s government as being worse than Sani Abacha’s.

Amaechi said that democracy was in danger in the country with the insecurity in the state and added that the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Joseph Mbu, had declared war on his administration and the people of the state.

He accused Mbu of being part of the attack on SRM supporters, maintaining that the Federal Government was desperate to win the 2015 elections.

The governor said, “There is a serious danger for democracy because what you are seeing here is close to what Abacha was doing.

“This is worse than the Abacha government. Here, people are being shot. This is worse because even governors were not arrested under Abacha.

“We heard Mbu called a meeting at the police officers mess and declared war on the Rivers State Government and Rivers State people. He is determined to ensure that they are not protected. He warned policemen in the state in advance not to protect anybody at the rally.

“The interpretation of this is that he knew that there was going to be an attack and he must have been part of the process of the attack. If he did not, then when the people started shooting around 4am, what did the police do?

“It shows how desperate the Federal Government is to win 2015 election. As the governor of Rivers State, if you hear gunshot from 4am, we will seek protection from that 4am; we will go and look for those who are shooting from 4am to 6am.

“They attacked pressmen and the Commissioner of Police did not care. I heard two persons are lying critically ill in the hospital.

“The lives of our people are not being protected because he (Jonathan) sent a police commissioner through his wife to pursue an election that is one year away.”

Amaechi,who vowed that botched Sunday rally would be held on Saturday, promised to be at the venue.

“I will want to expose myself, I will be there. I will be there on Saturday, let them come and shoot me,” he said.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, said though he received report of the attack, he was not aware that anybody was injured.

Mohammad pointed out that the police were not notified about the SRM rally.

He said,“From the report I received, there was an attack on the SRM rally in Bori. Nobody said that anybody was injured.

“But the gathering by the group was without police notification. Nobody notified the police that there would be a rally in Bori.”

Meanwhile, the Supervising Minister of Education, Chief Nyesom Wike, has boasted that Amaechi would never rest unless he resigned as the state governor.

Wike, who spoke at a rally organised by the Grassroots Development Initiative in Degema on Sunday , described the All Progressives Congress as the enemy of the state.

He called on any group supporting Amaechi to learn from the GDI by obtaining permission from the police before embarking on any rally.

The minister said that Jonathan had good intentions for the people of the state and hence the appointment of a Chief of Army Staff from the state.

The deceased, from Gbagyi tribe, was stabbed to death with a dagger by a teenage Hausa boy who was allegedly involved in a rape case.

The incident which was said to have happened at about 7:00 pm Thursday threw the whole community into panic as the indigenes slept with one eyes opened over a possible spill over from same Hausa youths.

During the protest which lasted for several hours, the indigenes including young men and women demanded for justice with a call on the FCT Administration to map out ways of ending teenage criminality in Abuja..

The aggrieved residents took the protest march to the ever-busy Jabi Expressway down to Utako Police Station, carrying leaves as a sign of peace.

Expectedly, vehicles were prevented from moving freely.

The father of the deceased, Mr. Madaki Musa, said the incident occurred after he returned from the mosque.

According to him, when he saw his son engage in an argument with four young men who were not indigenes of the community, he decided to appeal to them to peacefully settle the issue amongst themselves.

One person was reportedly killed and many houses were set ablaze in the violence.

An eye witness, who claimed that he was among those that escaped from the scene of the crisis, told National Mirror that the violence broke out following refusal by the Fulani herdsmen to keep their cattle away from the farms of the natives.

According to the witness, the refusal sparked a protest by the farmers who insisted that the herdsmen must vacate their farmlands.

The witness said the refusal heightened the farmers’ provocation and thereby culminated in a clash between the two groups. One person was killed in the violence and property worth several millions of naira destroyed.

The development, however, caused panic among Logo Local Government residents as they fled their places of abode for fear of reprisal attack.

Sources said that over 300 residents, including children fled their homes to seek refuge or alternative accommodation with relations or friends as a result of the violence.

It will be recalled that a similar violence between Fulani herdsmen and Tiv farmers occurred last week at Anyebe and Gidan mango also near Anyiin where one person was allegedly killed.

Gunmen numbering about 80 suspected to be members of Boko Haram insurgents yesterday invaded Wala village, a Christian community of Gwoza Local Government area of Borno State, killing two persons, while several others sustained gunshot injuries.

The insurgents also set shops and residential houses ablaze carting away domestic livestock and food crops.

This brings to about 37 communities/settlements located on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest which have been sacked or displaced by terrorists in the state in the past one week.

The sacked settlements include, Ngawo Fate, Limanti, Mairamri, Yahuri, Alau, Mude, Kwaljiri, Njaba, Kaya, Wala among other villages of Gwoza, Konduga and Damboa Council areas, a situation that has left thousands of residents taking refuge in other places including Cameroon Republic.

Wala village is a border community with Cameroon Republic and about 150 kilometres south of Maiduguri, the Borno state capital which had witnessed series of deadly bomb blasts and shootings masterminded by terrorists.

The first one was on January 9 of this year, when a lawmaker’s house who is the only Christian House of Representative member from Borno was attacked. Although no live was lost in the first attack, the attackers carted away over 70 domestic animals before setting the buildings on fire.

While in the house, the attackers reportedly burnt a consignment of sorghum which was meant for distribution to his people to cushion their hardships.

They also burnt 30,000 pieces of exercise books, 30,000 packets of biro and 30,000 packets of chalk which were also allegedly meant for distribution to schools in his constituency, as well as a neighbouring church.

The latest sacking and killing of Wala residents according to a reliable source took place over the weekend, when a large number of terrorists invaded the village in broad daylight with knife, cutlasses and AK47 rifles, before they executed their deadly mission and fled.

The source explained that during the attack, a 35 year old Ahmadu Usman and Usman Jahawa suspected to be a younger brother to the former were killed by the insurgents, while several houses and shops were completely razed down by the attackers.

He added that prior to the two coordinated attacks on the community, there was a threat message from Boko Haram sects, that unless they denounce Christianity and join Islam, their lives will be in danger as they will be attacked soon."

It was yet another day of blood when Boko Haram attacked a community in North-Central part of Borno State, killing at least, 50 people on Sunday. The same cruel fate befell worshippers in a church in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State when about 40 people including two policemen were killed, also on same Sunday. About 90 people died in the two incidents.

In Borno, Boko Haram men reportedly stormed Kawuri village in Konduga Local Government, about 45 kilometers to Maiduguri, the state capital and birthplace of the insurgency. The attack, according to sources, occurred on Sunday evening and lasted till the early hours of yesterday. Residents described it as “bloody and tragic.”

Police sources said the attackers who came in large number and wore military camouflage, invaded the community at about 5pm on Sunday. Residents initially mistook them for soldiers until it dawned on them that they were actually Boko Haram men.

“They started putting fire in people’s houses after killing many people,” a police source claimed, adding that they also shot “indiscriminately and continued in that manner until the early hours of yesterday (Monday).” The source said the casualty was higher because Sunday was the community market day. “Many people usually pass the night there or leave late in the night,” another source stated.

Police Commissioner, Lawan Tanko, confirmed the attack to newsmen. He said 40 people were killed while 25 others were injured in the attack. He did not, however, give further details on the attack. Military sources said troops from the 7 Division have been immediately deployed to cordon off the area and prevent further attack.

Meanwhile, it was a bloody Sunday when Boko Haram attacked a church in Chakawa village in Madagali LGA.

Residents of the affected village, who fled the area, told newsmen that they were attacked by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram during Sunday service in the morning.

A resident, who identified himself as Moses, said though he could not ascertain the death toll, many people were killed. According to him, about 16 people were evacuated from the church.

Another resident, who identified himself as Apagu, claimed that some houses were also attacked by the gunmen, who took some men hostage, while two policemen, an inspector and a sergeant, who were on guard in the church, were killed on the spot.

All efforts to get the military and police authorities for comments proved abortive. However, members of the public are jittery over the incident.

The Chairman of Madagali council, Maina Ularamu, confirmed the attack, but declined to disclose the number of casualty."

Atrigger-happy soldier yesterday in Agbado in Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, went berserk and allegedly shot his colleague over an argument.

He also killed a 32-year- old tricyclist, identified as Sunday Samuel.

Daily Sun gathered that trouble started in Agbado, a border town at about 10 am when a group of soldiers stormed the tricycles park in the area to allegedly extort money.

During an argument that ensued between the soldiers and the tricyclists, a soldier (name withheld) allegedly shot Samuel dead over his alleged refusal to pay.

The killer-soldier also reportedly shot his colleague who had challenged him for shooting Samuel and thereafter attempted to run away before the long arm of the law caught up with him.

The murdered soldiers were said to be personnel of the Special Task Force on security in Jos.

The latest incident is coming barely 24 hours after the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr. Chris Olakpe, read the riot act to community leaders, threatening to arrest any of them who foment trouble in his domain.

A local Chinese contractor was killed about a week ago in the area that has been in crisis for over a decade.

Eyewitnesses said the gunmen invaded Atakar and Rajat communities of Riyom in their hundreds at about 3 am, killing 19 people and 11 in the respective communities.

Unspecified number of people were said to have been wounded while property were burnt down during the attack. Over 60 houses were said to have been razed by the gunmen.

The member representing Riyom constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Mr. Daniel Dem, confirmed the incident, which he described as sad.

He also confirmed the death of the soldiers.

“As we speak, those killed have been given mass burial. Scores of persons were injured and have fled their homes to neighbouring villages in Kaduna State,” he said.

He called on the Federal Government to deploy more troops in the area and to begin aerial surveillance in order to stop further attacks in the communities.

Efforts to reach the spokesman of the STF, Capt. Salisu Mustapha, were not successful as calls to his mobile phone were not answered.

But the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Felicia Anselm, confirmed an attack in the area.

She however said that the report she got did not indicate that anybody was killed.

“We got the report of an attack in the area, but the report I have on my table right now did not say that anybody was killed. I do not know of any other attack,” Anselm said.

“The bandits attacked and killed 18 traders; 10 from Kukuwa and eight from Dokshi villages and took away their money. The bandits were masked and wearing army uniform,” he said.

Residents of Aba have condemned Monday invasion of the police area command by soldiers lamenting that those who ought to unite and tackle the spate of kidnapping and other crimes in the state were involved in a show of shame.

Hell was let loose in Aba, Abia State when soldiers invaded the area command of the police in a Gestapo style and wounded two police officers.

The rampaging soldiers said to be over 50, stormed the police command in an Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and over five Hilux vans, and did not spear civilians within the neighbourhood of the area command headquarters. They were said to have cordoned off the area and forced businesses to close as people around scampered for safety.

In the ensuing fracas, the glass door of a patent medicine shop directly opposite the area command main entrance was shattered as soldiers allegedly stormed the shop to prevent one of the police officers wounded during the fracas from receiving first aid treatment.

Daily Sun gathered that trouble started at about 6.15pm on that day, when a police officer attached to the area command went to purchase some drugs with his pregnant wife, also a serving police officer and parked his car in front of the drugs store but a man who was later identified as an army captain ordered the police officer to remove his vehicle from where it was parked.

The cop was reported to have explained to the soldier that he was a police officer and that he would move as soon as he buys the drugs but the soldier refused and during an argument, the army captain allegedly slapped the policeman and he retaliated.

Other soldiers, who were inside the army van, came down with their guns and threatened to kill the policeman, but for the wife who insisted they should kill her first.

Although passersby, who had gathered to watch the ugly episode, later made peace between the two men, soldiers, who were said to have been alerted by the captain, stormed the police area command."

“Sequel to intelligence reports, the 79 Composite Group, in conjunction with 75 Strike Group, Yola, carried out air surveillance interdiction and raid on identified Boko Haram hideouts.

“The operation was conducted in Bulabulim,Yujiwa-Alagarno, all located around Damboa axis of Borno State.

•CAN urges FG to stop killings

Seriki Adinoyi and John Shiklam

The orgy of killings in Plateau State continued Thursday as gunmen attacked Mavo village in Wase Local Government Area, killing 22 people.

The attack came two days after early dawn attacks on two villages in Riyom Local Government Area in which no fewer than 30 people were killed.

Worried by the killings, Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on the federal government to urgently intervene to guarantee the safety of lives in the affected areas.

An eyewitness from the village, who gave his name as Nangak, told reporters in Jos that gunmen stormed the village at about 2 am and set their houses on fire.

The gunmen, who laid ambush for the villagers, opened fire on them as they were trying to flee from the inferno.

Another resident, who spoke with THISDAY on the phone, confirmed that over 10 houses were razed in the inferno.

Irked by the attack, youths of the community mobilised one another for a protest that was quickly repelled by security operatives.

Wase Local Government Area has become a tinderbox in recent times as Taroh and Fulani in the area have been at loggerheads.

The Interim Administrator of the local government, Mr. Zakari Haruna, who confirmed the attack, however declined to speak on the casualty figure.

He said peace had been restored to the community.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Felicia Anslem, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), also confirmed the attack, but said she was yet to be fully briefed on the extent of damage and the casualty figure.

Meanwhile, the leadership of CAN in Kaduna State yesterday urged the federal government to address the frequent attacks on communities in the Southern part of the state and Plateau State before the situation degenerates into genocide.

The state chairman of the association, Bishop George Dodo, at a press conference in Kaduna, also condemned the weekend killing of Zaria-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Mohammed Awwal-Albani, along with his son and wife.

Dodo said the attacks being unleashed on communities in Kaduna and Plateau States were unacceptable, more so that the perpetrators always got away without being arrested.

According to him, those who committed the atrocities are not ‘spirits’ but human beings and there is no reason why they cannot be arrested if security agents are ready to effectively discharge their responsibilities.

He urged the security operatives to search the bushes bordering the two states, where the bandits are suspected to be hiding in a bid to fish out the killers.

Dodo warned that failure of the government to arrest those engaged in the senseless killings in the two states might force the citizens to resort to self-help to protect themselves.

He said the government must wake up to its responsibilities of safeguarding the lives and property of citizens by fishing out the perpetrators of “these evil doers” and punish them in accordance with the law.

“The deteriorating state of security of lives and property of the people in Kaduna State, especially the southern part in the recent past, and the seeming inability of our security agencies to curb the trend has necessitated this press conference. This situation is simply unfortunate.

“There must be determined steps taken by security agencies to comb the area with a view to flushing out the terrorists in that area and ensuring the security of lives and property of the people.

“Governments must not allow the unfortunate experience of Central African Republic (CAR) to happen in Nigeria. The genocide along religious and ethnic lines does no good to anybody in that African nation,” Dodo said."

It was gathered that men of the Mariga Divisional Police, acting on a tip-off, arrested one of the suspected armed robbers at the ever-busy Mariga market.

The suspect, Mamman Sodangi, was taken to the station for questioning, where it was discovered that his bag contained three AK 47 rifles, 50 rounds of live ammunition and three magazines.

The suspect confessed that he belonged to a gang of armed robbers that had been terrorising residents of the area including neighbouring states of Kebbi, Zamfara and Kaduna, particularly on market days.

He said the gang leader resided at Farin Shinga near Kontagora in Niger state.

He led the operatives to the village, where the gang leader, Buba Jabbi, was arrested.

The source explained that other members of the gang, however, laid an ambush for the policemen on their way back to Mariga, which led to a shootout between the police and the bandits.

The Policemen were said to have gunned down two of the robbers, who were shot below the abdomen but couldn’t survive, as they were said to have later died at the General Hospital, Bangi, where they were on admission.

In the same vain, the Police also arrested one suspect, Abubakar Mohammed, believed to be a member of Miyetti Allah Association from Karu, who was in possession of 20 rounds of live ammunition and a magazine."

Yesterday was another day of tragedy in Adamawa State as unknown gunmen reportedly killed six persons and razed 39 houses in Masu village in Toungo Local Government Area. An impeccable source from Toungo disclosed that the attackers were suspected mercenaries hired by Fulani herdsmen who had problems with the villagers who are predominantly farmers.

“The attackers outrageously came into the town and attacked innocent persons. This problem started about three months ago when herdsmen entered a local farm and the villagers called an army patrol team who arrested and subjected them to serious drill and beating.”

“The development angered the Fulani community in the area who decided to call on all their members to boycott the cattle market in protest,” Aliyu said.

The source further said that was the climax of the tension that led to gunmen attacking the village on Friday morning, leading to the killing of four villagers with many others injured and now receiving treatment at Toungo cottage hospital.

A resident who simply identified himself as Aliyu, said, two of the suspected attackers were killed by security agents while trying to escape bringing the death toll to six, “39 houses were also razed by the attackers,” he said.

The Lagos-based motor dealer was said to have been kidnapped by gunmen at a petrol station in Ido around 8am, while buying petrol shortly after dropping his mother at the Ido Market.

Our correspondent learnt that Fadeyi, who is the Mayegun of Ido, arrived at Ekiti from Lagos during the weekend.

His sister, who gave her name simply as Idowu, said the kidnappers demanded N10m ransom from the family.

Idowu, while speaking in a telephone interview, said a relation, who was in the car with Fadeyi, reported the incident at the Ido Police Station.

According to her, a search party was raised by concerned members of the community.

She said, “The police, commercial drivers and motorcyclists gave a chase but the kidnappers escaped in a

Honda car which later had an accident at Ifisin community. But they escaped.”

A police source in the community confirmed the incident, saying, “We are not sure if the kidnappers traced him from his base in Lagos. He was only visiting his family in the community.”

Meanwhile, the Ekiti State Police Command on Monday confirmed that six men had been arrested in connection with their alleged roles in the shooting and killing of Julius Ojo, a member of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria in the state.

Although, the identities of the six persons were not disclosed, they were said to be supporters of a former leader of the union.

The killing of Ojo, the newly appointed Caretaker Chairman for Ikere-Akure Unit of the association was the climax of the crisis between the two warring factions of the union.

The Bukuru incident created tension that spread to the city centre as some shop owners hurriedly locked up while some parents hurried to their children’s schools to take them home.

A resident, Mallam Ali Yakubu, said the gunmen succeeded in killing several people after dislodging some security operatives in the area.

He added that the gunmen, numbering over 100, came with several vehicles and motorcycles. Some of them wore military camouflage, chanting Allahu Akbar (God is Great) and shot anyone they sighted before displacing residents after setting many houses and business centres ablaze.

“As I am talking to you now, all the dead bodies of the victims are still laying on the streets as we could not get the opportunity of burying them because of fear that the terrorists are still around the nearby bushes of Izge to see if people will carry the dead bodies to the grave yards for burial, so that they can ambush all of us, although the security operatives have been alerted on the development, we are yet to see any of them deployed to the area.

“I thank God for sparing my life yesterday because I thought my own days in this world are over when we started hearing the sound of gunshots and explosions all over Izge in the night.

“But as God will have mercy on me and my people, we ran into the bush without being hurt by the insurgents. When we came back to the village about 8: 25a.m., we met our house completely burnt down by the insurgents.”

When contacted on the phone, the Borno State Police Commissioner, Mr. Lawal Tanko, confirmed the incidents.

He said: “Yes, there were separate attacks in Baga Village, located on an island of the Lake Chad where about nine people were killed on Friday, while the Sunday morning terrorists’ attack in Izge village of Gwoza Local Government Area led to the death of many innocent civilians.

“I have already directed my Divisional Police Officer in-charge of the area to the scene and when he fed me back with details I will let you know, but as at now, I don’t have details on the number of casualties,” Tanko said.

Meanwhile, a Jos-based Muslim group operating under the aegis of Muslim Youths for Justice, MYJ, yesterday expressed concern over the continued detention of Dr. Mohammed Nazeef Yunus, the Kogi State University lecturer currently facing trial for alleged terrorist activities before a Federal High court in Abuja.

The group in a statement signed by its President, Ustaz Usman Muhammad Abdullah, and Secretary, Shehu Muhammad, and made available to journalists in Jos yesterday said it was worried that the health of the Islamic scholar was deteriorating due to his continuous detention and lack of proper medication.

The statement added: “We are disturbed that even before Dr. Yunus was remanded in Kuje prison on the order of the High court as at the last adjournment, his health condition suffered serious setback due to his none accessibility to medication which he was on before his arrest. We are also worried that his long detention in the deadly dusky cell of the Department of State Service (DSS), has caused a new illness to his sight.”

It further stated that the charges of alleged terrorism that was filled by the office of the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, was done in other to ensure that the cleric remains in detention.

While appreciating the leadership and concern of the President General of the National Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in Nigeria, Sultan Sa’ad Abubakar of Sokoto, the group called on his intervention the statement added."

By Senator Iroegbu, Michael Olugbode and Daji Sani

Members of the outlawed Boko Haram sect struck at the weekend in eight villages in Adamawa and Borno States, killing over 158 people.

The attacks, which happened on Saturday night, have forced about 100,000 residents of the villages to flee over fears that the insurgents could come again to kill more people.



However, the federal government in a bid to stem the tide of the attacks, has sent more troops to the terror-stricken villages.

It was gathered that the insurgents killed over 65 people in the attacks on seven villages in Adamawa State, while about 93 others were killed when the terrorists struck at a village in Borno State.



An eyewitness who identified himself as Adamu Bulama told reporters in a telephone interview in Yola yesterday that he saw 40 corpses with gun wounds apart from those who were killed in their houses that he could not specify their number.

He gave the names of villages attacked as Kirchang, Kwambula, Shuwa, Yinagu, Bitiku, Yazza and Dagu, stressing that the gunmen finished their operations comfortably and left without been harassed.

He said the gunmen went about the killings without fear of being repelled by anybody.

Another source from Yazza village said he saw corpses of about 25 persons, adding that he and others narrowly escaped the gunmen when they attacked their village.



Chairman of Madgali Local Government Area, Maina Ularamu, who spoke in a telephone interview, confirmed the attacks.

He said: ""I am in Abuja but I have received a report that more than 10,000 people have trooped into Gulak town and many of them are stranded on the streets because the houses that accommodated them were occupied and there was no more space. I have just given an instruction that a primary school be opened for them.""

He however said he could not give the exact death toll from the attacks because he was in Abuja on an official assignment.

His Adviser on Security Matters, Walkari Umaru, said thousands of people from Izzghe and others villagers were in Gulak, expressing fear that their number could outstretch resources.



Umaru called on the state government to respect the court decision which brought Ularamu as the chairman of Madgali Local Government Area and allow him access to the monthly subvention which he had been denied for four months to enable him assist refugees and victims of insurgency in the area.

He also appealed to the Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, to ensure the deployment of adequate military equipment to the area with a view to tackling the security problem in the North-east.

The outlawed group also attacked another village, Izge, in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State on Saturday evening, and killed over 90 persons.



The sect has been on the rampage in the last couple of weeks roving round villages in the state, killing persons without caution. Only last Tuesday, the insurgents killed over 60 people in Konduga.

Sources told journalists yesterday in Maiduguri that the hoodlums laid siege on the hilly village, killing at will and inflicting severe injuries on the residents.

The source said at present, many of the villagers were missing while those who survived the attack had started moving out of the village.



A resident of the area, Mallam Ali Bulama, also told journalists in Maiduguri that the gunmen, who were dressed in military camouflage, invaded the town at about midnight on Saturday. They killed 93 people, and inflicted injuries on many others.

He said: ""As I speak to you, many residents of Izge are missing and those lucky enough to be alive have started leaving.""

Bulama explained that the terrorists, who were about 100, came with sophisticated weapons and started shooting sporadically, setting many houses and shops ablaze.



An indigene of the town based in Maiduguri, Adamu Izge, who said he lost his father-in-law in the siege, told journalists that the ""insurgents stormed the area at about midnight on Saturday wearing military uniforms and were well armed with sophisticated weapons and launched massive attack on the village killing many persons while many others are missing and injured.""

He said the insurgents razed the whole community and even followed those that escaped to the nearby villages and killed them.

According to him, members of the Izge community in Maiduguri have expressed their displeasure to both the federal and state governments over the incessant attacks by insurgents on their village with no concrete measures taken by the government to avert the situation.



He lamented that the entire area of Gwoza, Bama, Konduga and Damboa towns has been under siege by the insurgents in recent time and called on the federal government to deploy more military personnel and equipment in the area.

The Borno State Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Lawal Tanko, who confirmed that there was an attack on Izge, when contacted by newsmen, could not however give details on the casualty figures.



But in a bid to stem the tide of the terrorist attacks, the federal government has deployed more troops in the terror-stricken areas.

It has also sent relief materials to Konduga Local Government Area of the state, which was recently attacked by the Islamic sect.

A source confided in THISDAY at the weekend that more troops had been deployed in the troubled areas to contain the activities of the insurgents as well as flush them out from that part of the country.



The source said all measures had been put together to restore peace and normalcy in the troubled parts of Adamawa and Borno States.

""While more troops have been deployed for protection of lives and property, relief materials have been sent with intelligence aspect of the counter-offensive in top gear,"" he added.



Relief materials, including food items, toiletries, clothing and other basic needs, have also been sent to Konduga by officials of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) led by its North-west Zonal Coordinator, Mr. Muhammad Kanar.

Kanar in a statement by the Zonal Information Officer, North-east, Mr. Abdulkadir Ibrahim, said with the destruction of markets in the community, the gesture of the federal government was well-received by thousands of residents who trooped out from their homes and hideouts to receive the materials.



He assured members of the community that more items, including building materials, would soon be distributed to rehabilitate some of the structures destroyed in the recent attacks.

""NEMA has undertaken many of such interventions in recent times in various communities in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States where a state of emergency has been declared as a result of the insurgent activities,"" he said."

Gidan Sule village, a suburb of Kadarko town, is in Giza development area of the state and is on the border between Nasarawa and Benue States, about 45 kilometres south of Lafia, the Nasarawa state capital.

Border communities in the two states had, in the last three years, witnessed persistent clashes between farmers and herdsmen and such clashes were reported to have claimed several lives and property running into millions of naira.

Reports said hundreds of farmers in the area were yet to return to their ancestral homes long after they had been displaced in such previous clashes.

According to an eyewitness, the suspected herdsmen attacked the village along the Lafia-Makurdi road, at about 6.00 am, shooting sporadically at any object even as they set houses within the vicinity ablaze simultaneously.

The eyewitness, who spoke with National Mirror, confirmed the names of the two persons killed in the attack to be Emmanuel Mbashav and Doosen Ornguga, while another of the victims, Msugh Ornguga, survived the attack but was left with multiple wounds he sustained from gunshots from the suspected herdsmen.

Consequent upon the attack, hundreds of people in the communities around the area were said to be evacuating their families to neighbouring Benue State, even as tension enveloped the surrounding communities of Kadarko, Gidan Kparev in Nasarawa State and Yelewata in Benue State for fear of possible attacks by the herdsmen on their communities.

The Nasarawa and Benue State governments had in the last three years being making frantic efforts to bring an the end to the persistent clashes between the farmers and the herdsmen without any fruitful result, hence the clashes continued unabated.

Nasarawa State Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Idrisu Kennedy, when contacted on phone by our correspondent yesterday denied knowledge of the attack as according to him; “The command is yet to get a signal to that effect.”"

More than 200 hoodlums said to be Ogbaru youths, armed with guns machetes and other dangerous weapons had invaded the park managed by Lutas Collections on Thursday in a plot to take over the management of the park.

They were however resisted by the mangers of the park and their sympathisers. The clash led to the death of two people and injury to many other people in several hours of violence that paralysed social and economic activities in Onitsha.

The soldiers and policemen at the park were directing affairs at the park on Friday as they scrutinized passengers to sort out people who could make trouble.

Lutas Collection was appointed by the Anambra State Government to manage and collect revenue for it in the park.

The Chairman of Lutas Collections, Chief Okafor expressed disappointment that after paying the government the necessary dues to manage the park he has not been allowed to recoup his money by the incessant attacks by hoodlums at the park.

He said that the incessant attacks have led to the loss of over N2.5 million and endangered the lives of his workers.

He appealed to the Anambra State Government to intervene and flush out the hoodlums from the park to save the lives of the Nigerian citizens who use the park.

He called on the Nigerian police to rise up to their responsibility to protect genuine business men who are helping the government to ensure sanity at the parks.

The Divisional Police officer in charge of the area, Mr. Emeka Ugwu confirmed the incident, but said that only one person who sustained machete injury died in the clash, he however said that the police has taken over security in the park and its environs.

They perpetrated their nefarious act by feigning to be operators of taxi cabs and motorcyclists Aba, the commercial nucleus of the state, and Umuahia, the state capital.

Yesterday, two women travelling to Uzuakoli market in Bende Local Government Area of the state were kidnapped and taken to an unknown destination.

Their families are now in agony, misery and guessing where the destination was.

One of the women, simply identified as Mrs. Nkechi, was said to be a nursing mother of an eightmonth old baby.

She trades in garri and other allied food stuff and was going to the local market for stock, not knowing she was to be a victim of kidnappers posing as motorists.

Reliable sources disclosed that though the women live in Umuahia, they hailed from Ebonyi State.

Eyewitness accounts disclosed that the kidnap suspects were seen speeding towards the Umuahia/ Aba/Enugu expressway after their operation.

Also, on Monday, some gunmen reportedly abducted a six- month old baby boy at Amapu Umuaja village in Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area of Abia State.

It was gathered that at about 9.30pm on the day of the incident when most villagers had gone to bed, two gunmen on a motorcycle stormed the compound of the victim’s parents, broke into their house and forcefully snatched the baby from his mother, Mrs. Peace Chikezie.

The whereabouts of the baby is unknown.

After snatching the baby from the mother, the gunmen reportedly fled, and in an apparent move to stop the woman from alerting other villagers, they forcefully collected her mobile phone.

It was after the hoodlums had fled with the baby that the mother raised the alarm and a search team was set to comb the entire neighbourhood to see if the marauders could be apprehended, but all to no avail.

Nobody in the area was able to adduce reason for the baby’s abduction, but there was a general belief that ritual for money making could be the motivating factor.

Some villagers who spoke to our correspondent described the incident as barbaric and satanic, stressing that this was the first time such would be happening in the community.

Abia State Police Public Relations Officer, Geoffrey Ogbonna, could not be a reached as at the time of filing this report.

However, a senior police officer who would not want his name in print confirmed the incident. He said the matter had been reported at the Umuoba Divisional Police Headquarters for proper investigation, adding that police were already on top of the matter to recover the child and also apprehend the hoodlums."

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the incident, which occurred on Wednesday, involved youths from Okposi-Okwu and Amenuegu-Okposi villages.

An eyewitness, who spoke with NAN on condition of anonymity, said trouble started when a group of boys waylaid and beat up a girl from Amenuegu village before another boy, Nwabueze Nwachukwu, tried to rescue her.

The eyewitness said, “The boys subsequently attacked and stabbed Nwachukwu to death, which made youths of the community go berserk, and destroyed properties worth millions of naira in the process.

“The irate youths on getting to the shop and residential building of Chief Abah Nwankwo at Ohammahi, Okposi-Okwu, destroyed three buildings in the compound.

“Two motorcycles were also burnt alongside his livestock such as goats and dogs, among others.”

Narrating his ordeal to NAN, Mr Lazarus Nwankwo, the younger brother to Chief Nwankwo, said the heavily armed boys numbering more than 20, beat up his elder brother to a state of coma before taking him away.

Mrs. Obidiya Okoro-Eze from Mkpuma-Nweze village said the youths also burnt all her clothes.

“My son was, however, involved in beating the deceased and though my family handed him over to them, they still destroyed everything inside the compound and stole my N12, 000.

The Coordinator of Okposi Development Centre, Mr. Mark Onu, said the situation had been brought under control through his quick intervention.

Few hours before the incident, another batch of insurgents launched a vicious attack on Jakana in the Kaga Local Government Area of Borno State.

Eleven elderly people were among the 40 victims that died in the attack, the fourth in the last three days in Borno State.

Military sources and eyewitnesses made these known to our correspondents just as it was gathered that many residents of Benisheik and Muna in Borno State fled their homes following threats by Boko Haram to attack their two communities on Tuesday night.

It was learnt that the insurgents suffered heavy casualties in the operation described as one of the most successful outings of the Air Force since the commencement of the campaign against Boko Haram.

“On Monday night, they attempted to attack Damaturu; they were advancing towards the city when they were sighted but soldiers and Air Force fighters countered them.

‘Several of them were killed in that fight and a security personnel was also shot to death.

“The Air Force did very well; I think that is one of the best battles of the Air Force since this thing (campaign against terrorists) started.”

The PUNCH gathered on Tuesday that the insurgents stormed Jakana around 11.30pm on Monday and had fierce gunfight with troops mostly drawn from the 7th Infantry Division.

The terrorists were however said to have succeeded in burning down the village and the only police station on the Maiduguri/Damaturu highway even though many of them were killed.

It was further gathered that the soldiers seized a Mercedes Benz 9/11 truck abandoned by the insurgents.

Three soldiers were however said to have sustained gunshot wounds while two policemen were shot to death.

A resident, who did not want his name in print, said, “When they (insurgents) came into the town, we thought they were soldiers until they began to shout ‘Allahu Akbar’ and spray bullets on everything. Realising that they were Boko Haram people and not soldiers, we took to our heels.”

He added that while they were running, some of them were hit and killed by bullets while some were lucky enough to escape to Maiduguri through the bushes.

Another resident interjected, saying, “I am one of those lucky enough to find myself among others in Maiduguri after running through the bushes. We arrived near the military check- point at Computer Village on the outskirts of Maiduguri.”

As of 9pm on Monday, the official casualty figure could not be ascertained.

Senator Ahmed Zannah, who represents Borno Central, told journalists that the insurgents burnt 11 elderly people to death in some of the houses they set fire on.

He also said that many residents, who got wind of the insurgents’ plan to attack them fled the community.

The lawmaker claimed that soldiers who initially fled on sighting the insurgents later regrouped and confronted them.

According to him, the insurgents retreated but warned that they would return to “finish the unfinished business.”

The threat, he said, made more residents to flee to Maiduguri “out of fear.”

The Director of Defence Information, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, confirmed the attack on Jakana on Monday night in a telephone conversation with one of our correspondents.

Olukolade was, however, silent on the casualty figure.

“It is true that there was an attack on Jakana but I don’t have the details now,” he said.

Investigations also revealed that tension was high in Benisheik and Muna early on Tuesday as Boko Haram was said to have written the residents informing them that their communities were to be attacked at night.

It was learnt that even though the military had placed soldiers on red alert, the residents of the two communities left for safer places.

A source said, “They(Boko Haram) wrote to Muna and Benisheik threatening to attack them this(Tuesday) night. Soldiers are however on the alert.

“But some of the inhabitants of the villages are leaving because they believe the people may come. They don’t want to be there during the fighting.”

The Defence Spokesman also confirmed the arrest of the mastermind of the twin bomb blasts in Bintu Sugar Ngamari, Maiduguri on Saturday.

Olukolade, who had earlier announced the arrest of two suspects, said the interrogation of the mastermind had commenced.

“The mastermind has been arrested; he went in to a coma, but he has been revived, and interrogation has since commenced. He is the one directly responsible for the bomb blasts,” he added.

Meanwhile, the National Emergency Management Agency has said that 55,500 internally displaced persons have been attended to in Borno State since the beginning of this year.

The Information Officer, North-East zonal office of the agency, AbdulKadir Ibrahim, told journalists on Tuesday that most of the displaced persons had shunned camps set up by the agency for them for fear of being attacked by insurgents.

Also on Tuesday, the Catholic Bishop of Maiduguri Diocese, Most Rev. Oliver Dashe Doeme, said that Boko Haram was a product of corruption.

Dashe, who called on government to find ways to end the insurgency, said, “If corruption goes, there will be no Boko Haram, no kidnapping and no armed robbery. Even if they exist, they will be minimal. If Nigerians are empowered, they will not engage in some of these vices.”

He lamented that over 500 members of the church, 20 churches and priests’ apartments had been burnt down since the insurgency began in 2009.

The cleric said, “Though it will be hard to give an accurate figure, I cannot talk of Christians and Muslims but since 2009, we have had over 500 Catholics killed.

“Since 2009, we have been witnessing the senseless and merciless killings of our people, both Christians and Muslims.

“Corruption is number one problem of the nation; the Boko Haram insurgency is a product of corruption. The Federal Government should fight corruption headlong. It is sad that few people are sitting on billions of naira. The youths that are involved in Boko Haram activities could have distanced themselves from it if they were given opportunities.”

Though no contact had been established between Akatakpo’s family and the hoodlums, the radio presenter’s captors left a message for the pregnant wife to pay N10 million as ransom or risk the killing of her husband.

It was gathered that the kidnappers took away wristwatches and other personal belongings before whisking him away at about 3am.

A source close to the family told The PUNCH that the operation lasted for one hour in Akatakpo’s house located within a developing area in Obio/Akpor.

The source pointed out that though the victim did not resist the move to take him away, one of his captors shot him on the leg.

It was learnt that Akatakpo, whose whereabouts is yet unknown after the incident, moved into his personal house few months ago.

“Kidnappers early this morning, at about 2am, invaded the house of Diplomatic Akas Baba. They shot him on the leg. The wife, who is heavily pregnant, was told to pay N10 million for her husband to be released.

“He (Diplomatic Akas Baba) moved into his private house some months ago. The house is in a developing area and that was why the kidnappers operated for about one hour without any challenge,” another source told The PUNCH.

The statement stated, “Troops are still in pursuit of the fleeing terrorist elements after the encounter which resulted in some casualties on both parties.

“Rockets and machine guns were freely used by the terrorists who eventually lost over eight of their fighters with several others wounded. Arms were also captured from the terrorists while others fled.

“The troops, however, lost a soldier while an officer was seriously wounded in the encounter.”

Goniri is not far from Buni-Yadi where the terrorists killed schoolchildren recently.

The director also said the soldiers, operating around Gamboru Ngala and Dikwa Local Government Area towards Nigeria’s borders with Chad and Cameroon, were busy throughout the weekend.

He said the troops were recovering weapons hidden by terrorists who were dislodged from the area.

“Assisted by captured terrorists, the troops were led to the sites where arms have been hidden in farms and cemeteries. The cordon and search of the entire area is still in progress,” he said."

National Mirror gathered that the cultists who emerged from a nearby bush stormed the campus as students were seated for their ongoing semester examinations, causing pandemonium that led to temporary disruption of the examination as students scampered for safety.

One of the victims, it was gathered, was attacked near the institution’s medical centre, where he was said to have been hacked with several matchet cuts.

Men of the Nigeria Police were immediately drafted to the campus to bring the situation under control.

A member of the Students’ Union Government, SUG, anonymously disclosed that the victim was rushed to the hospital’s intensive care unit, but couldn’t survive because of the severity of the injury.

It was gathered that the battleground later shifted to Ikot Ekpene in the night, leading to closure of shops, relaxation points, fuel stations and other public places as the rampaging cultists wreaked havoc on the city in search of members of the rival cult group.

A source hinted that one suspected cultists, a drycleaner, was shot along Aya road and another near Ikot Ekpene’s main motor park.

The Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Deputy Superintendent Etim Dickson, while confirming the incident, said he could not ascertain the state of health of the victim because of the multiple wounds sustained.

He, however, said that the command had drafted a riot police squad to the campus and environs to protect lives and property"
1916,"Special forces capture BH leader, kill 70 insurgents",3/20/2014,Bita,Gwoza,Borno,70,Boko Haram,State Actor,,,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gun,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.punchng.com/news/special-forces-capture-bharam-leader-kill-70-insurgents/,,,#ERROR!,#ERROR!,"Gwoza, Borno, Nigeria",Nigeria,"The campaign against insurgents in the North-East intensified with the capture of a top leader of Boko Haram and the killing of about 70 insurgents at the sect’s stronghold in Gwoza Hills, Borno State.

Saturday PUNCH investigations revealed that the leader was arrested on Thursday evening while he was trying to flee the bombarded Gwoza Hills with some black Toyota Land Cruiser sports utility vehicle in his escort.

It was learnt that the Special Forces captured him alive and flew him immediately out of Borno State to Abuja for interrogation in one of the military formations in Abuja.

A source, who confided in our correspondent, said that the arrest of the man suspected to be one of the topmost commanders of the sect (if not the leader), had triggered anxiety among security agents in Borno State.

Security officials were of the view that the captured Boko Haram leader might be a very key person to the operation of the sect for him to have such a massive and luxurious escort comprising Toyota Land Cruiser vehicles.

The source said, “On Thursday, soldiers arrested a top member of the Boko Haram around the Gwoza Hills after the battle of Wednesday night when troop took over the hills.

“The Boko Haram member must be a very high ranking member of the group if not the head because he had several Toyota Land Cruiser jeeps in his escort when he was captured.

“Another thing is that they didn’t want anybody to know his identity; the commanders immediately flew the man to Abuja; as we are talking, the man is being interrogated there. A highly placed security source confirmed the arrest of the Boko Haram leader but would not make any further comment on the issue.

Investigations further revealed that troops killed over 70 insurgents at Bita community in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State and Bama headquarters of Bama Local Government Area of Borno State.

The insurgents were said to have been killed in two different gun duels with troops at Bita and Bama where Armoured Personnel Carriers and military tanks were fully deployed for the combat on Thursday.

Investigation revealed that the soldiers attacked the insurgents when they were moving to launch an attack on Bita community a day after troops overran their Gwoza Hills enclave on Wednesday.

The source said that some soldiers sustained gunshot wounds and were being treated at a hospital in Maiduguri. It was learnt that some other insurgents were killed also on Thursday evening on their way to Bama after the first encounter which resulted in the killing of over 40 members of the sect.

It was gathered that the special forces waited for the convoy of the insurgents on their way to Bama when an intelligence report was received that they (the insurgents) were on their way to launch another attack in Bama.

A security source said that the insurgents were moving in 15 trucks loaded with fighters when they ran into the ambush of the troops.

The source said that the troops destroyed seven of the trucks which caught fire and killed about 30 of the insurgents.”

However, it was stated that the insurgents escaped with eight of the vehicles in the convoy.

When our correspondent contacted the Director of Defence Information, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, he confirmed the deployment of APCs and military tanks but asked to be given more time to confirm the capture of the Boko Haram commander and those killed in the two battles.

“That APCs and military tanks were deployed is no news but you have to give me some time to confirm this story from the relevant places,” he said.

However, Olukolade said that the troops arrested a middle-aged Cameroonian who served as the arms courier for the sect.

He said that the arrest of the Cameroonian led to the discovery of a large cache of arms and ammunition which was hidden in the premises of a burnt church.

Olukolade said that weapons recovered from the insurgents in the premises of the church in Kalabalge Local Government Area of Borno State included anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled guns, other brands of machine guns and thousands of various calibres of rounds of ammunition.

He said that the Cameroonian led troops on a cordon and search operation to a hideout where a terrorist was captured. He was silent on the rank of this particular terrorist whose singular arrest featured in his news statement.

Our correspondent gathered that seven of those killed were the cattle thieves while a youth from Wase town was allegedly shot by security operatives when he was seen carrying fire arms.

He was said to have been shot when he allegedly resisted arrest.

It was gathered that cattle rustlers from Kadarko in the same local government had attacked some herdsmen on Saturday evening.

The herders were said to have sought refuge in Wase town which led to a shootout between the rustlers and the youths from Wase town

A resident of Wase, Ibrahim Audu, told newsmen that the youths had engaged the rustlers in a shootout, which claimed the lives of seven cow thieves.

He said, “I think those who escaped went back to tell other members because around 7am today (on Sunday) they came back with reinforcement and there was sporadic shootings.

“We saw them approaching Wase town and so we armed ourselves and went to repel them.”

The secretary of Wase Youths, Adamu Shuaibu, said a youth from Wase town was shot dead by a member of the Special Task Force.

He said, “The STF saw two of our youths armed after we had repelled the rustlers so they tried to arrest them and because one of them resisted arrest, he was shot dead. The other one was arrested and taken to Jos.

“The incident almost led to a break down of law and order between our youths and the security operatives because the youths were angry that the security men were unable to protect the community yet they are now arresting those who protect us.”

The Police Public Relations Officer, Felicia Anselem, said there were shootings in Wase on Sunday but could not ascertain the casualty figure.

Anselem said security agents had cordoned off the area to prevent further attacks."

They (gunmen) forced them to wake up when they threatened to set their house on fire if they refused to open the door.

It was further learnt that the father of the business mogul managed to escape from the kidnappers, but details of how he escaped still remained sketchy.

Checks by Punch Metro showed that the couple might have been abducted due to an alleged unresolved issues between their businessman son and his workers over unpaid wages.

It was gathered that no contact had yet been established with the abductors as of press time.

Already, the police authorities in the state have confirmed the abduction.

They however said two suspects linked with the incident were in their custody in Yenagoa.

Police Public Relations Officer in the state,Alex Akhigbe, said on Tuesday that the suspects had made useful statements that were assisting the police in their investigation.

Akhigbe, however, declined to disclose the identities of the kidnappers, saying the police were working out modalities to free the kidnapped woman and arrest her abductors.

Recently, communities in Bayelsa, such as Brass, Southern Ijaw and Ogbia LGAs have been the hotbeds of kidnappers.

Meanwhile, suspected sea pirates have attacked a passenger boat traveling from Okpotuwari to Otuan in Southern Ijaw LGA in the state.

The sea pirates were said to have ordered all the passengers to jump into river before they stole the engine of the speed boat.

An eyewitness, who craved anonymity, said no casualty was recorded during the incident.

He, however, said the woman who chartered the boat was still in shock.

The passengers were allegedly returning from a wake at Okpotuwari when the assailants accosted them."

It took the extra effort of a military patrol team on a special assignment in the town to contain the fracas after more than 30 minutes of confusion.

NAN reports that canisters of tear gas were fired before the warring parties could be dispersed, a development that paralysed traffic in the town.

Vehicular movement on Aperan Way, the major road in the town, linking the state with the neighbouring Ekiti State, was blocked as a result of the fracas.

An eye-witness told NAN on condition of anonymity that the police patrol team from the Omu-Aran Police Command accosted a navy personnel, who had escorted the wife of his boss to the market.

About 25 people, including All Progressives Congress, APC, members who were on their way to Maiduguri, to attend the stakeholders’ meeting/congresses were at the weekend killed by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in separate attacks in Gwoza Local Government Area, Borno State.

It was learnt that the attacks occurred on the Maiduguri- Biu road.

“About 18 delegates of the APC, who were on their way to attend a second stakeholders meeting slated for Sunday (yesterday) were ambushed by suspected terrorists in the bus they were travelling and killed,” a source.

Our correspondent also gathered that about seven motorists and passengers were shot dead by the suspected terrorists on the Maiduguri-Biu road, within the vicinity of Gwargube village.

The Maiduguri-Biu road has become a death trap in the past few weeks, as hardly a day passes without terrorists attacking and murdering travellers, despite the security operatives patrolling the road.

A member of the vigilance youth, a.k.a Civilian JTF, who did not want his name mentioned confirmed the attack in a telephone interview.

He said: “Some terrorists group yesterday laid ambush to some motorists and passengers along the Maiduguri- Biu road and killed many people. They later invaded Gwargube village and solicited support from the villagers or risk deadly attacks.

“Although when they invaded the village after the road ambush, they did not attack or kill anybody, they, however, warned the people to cooperate with them in their mission or risk their lives.”

A survivor of the attack on the bus conveying the APC delegates confirmed the attack.

The state Police Commissioner, Mr. Lawal Tanko, said he was not aware of the incident and was hearing it for the first time from our correspondent.

He, however, promised to investigate it and get back before going to press.

In Buni Gari, Yobe State, where 17 persons were killed on Saturday by insurgents, residents were already fleeing the town en masse to escape further attack by the terrorists.

The state Deputy Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Ali, was in the town yesterday and described the attack as “callous and unfortunate”.

“This is an unfortunate and merciless attack meted on innocent citizens without any sense of reasoning,” he said.

Ali lamented that the state had lost so many lives and properties to insurgency.

The state government has set up a committee to resettle the villagers and assess the level of damage.

The government directed the State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, to liaise with community leaders, National Union of Transport Workers, NURTW, and traders’ associations on how to assist the victims.

SEMA Executive Secretary, Alhaji Musa Idi, said the agency had already provided relief materials for the victims who lost their properties.

Many survivors have fled the village and taken refuge in Damaturu and its environs.

A resident, Ali Buni, confirmed the development.

He said: “If you were here yesterday, you will see people moving out of the town. Many people have left the town and more are leaving for fear of another attack.”

Our correspondent, who was in Buni Gari, saw many people moving towards Damaturu with their families.

An official of the NURTW said 52 vehicles and 10 Keke NAPEPs (auto rickshaws) were burnt by the insurgents.

Meanwhile, some military commanders have been accused by a soldier of working with the Boko Haram insurgents, which has been responsible for thousands of death since it began an uprising in 2009.

The soldier, who did not want his name mentioned, told a news agency yesterday that he had witnessed incidents that suggested that some military commanders were working with the sect.

Former Chief of Army Staff, COAS, Lt.-Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika (rtd), had also accused some soldiers of conniving with the Boko Haram to sabotage the military’s efforts in combating them.

In an exclusive interview with VOA’s Hausa Service, the unnamed soldier described how his military unit based in Borno State was ambushed by Boko Haram fighters.

The soldier said the commander of a nearby military unit, based in Bama, recently sought assistance from his unit in carrying out a raid.

He said that when the two military units joined up, they were given different uniforms. The Bama unit commander gave his own troops green uniforms. The soldier said his unit received tan “desert camouflage” uniforms.

When the troops reached the battle area, the soldier said the commander of the betterequipped Bama unit suddenly withdrew his forces, leaving the remaining troops to fend for themselves against Boko Haram fighters.

Speaking in Hausa, he said: “We had only light arms and our men were being picked off one after the other.”

The soldier also said he recognised some of the Boko Haram fighters as his former military trainers in Kontagora, a town near Abuja.

“We realised that some of them were actually mercenaries from the Nigerian Army… hired to fight us,” he said.

He also reiterated that commanders were pocketing money that was supposed to be used to help equip units.

It will be recalled that in a January 2012 speech, President Goodluck Jonathan said Boko Haram members had infiltrated the executive, legislative and judicial arms, as well as the police and armed forces.

A state of emergency was declared in the three states where Boko Haram was active, while the military launched operations to destroy the group’s camps. Despite these efforts, largescale attacks have continued.

Atlantic Council Africa Centre Director, Peter Pham, said the soldier’s account could have merit.

“It certainly would not surprise me that it is happening,” said Pham.

He said the goal should be to figure out how and why collaboration between military officers and terror groups could happen.

“What’s critical is to understand, if there is this collusion, to understand whether it is a collusion borne out of corruption, borne out of desperation simply to avoid combat that would result in casualties for the men under your command, or if it is borne out of ideological sympathy with the insurgents,” he said.

Apart from some welltrained elite units, Pham said most of Nigeria’s military was “woefully underfunded and under-resourced” in terms of equipment and training.

But the Army yesterday denied the report, saying military operatives were not conniving with the Boko Haram insurgents.

Director of Army Public Relations, DAPR, Brig.-Gen. Olajide Laleye, told National Mirror in Abuja that it was a matter of allegation and propaganda from faceless people that soldiers were having an alliance with the Boko Haram sect.

Laleye, who was surprised at the issue, said: “As far as I am concerned, this is an allegation. It is propaganda. So long as people could not put down names, such story stands untrue.”"

The septuagenarian, Chief Tola Okuneye, who was popularly called “Ajagajigi” was shot in the head by his assailants.

The suspected assassins stormed the church premises in two vehicles at about 11.00 am while the Sunday worship service was in progress.

National Mirror learnt that the suspected assassins headed straight for the pew where they located the deceased, took his life and fled the scene without taking anything away from him.

An eyewitness, who spoke with National Mirror on phone, explained that the preacher was about to mount the pulpit when the congregation noticed some armed youths entered the church and headed straight to where Chief Okuneye was sitting and shot him.

The witness said: “We were shocked and everybody was jittery as the service abruptly came to an end. Some people, especially elders, were still in shock as I am talking to you now”.

While ruling out the killing was political, the witness said the deceased was not a politician to warrant the suspicion that his opponents carried out the attack.

He said: “But as it is now, the church has been deserted except some few people who were with the cleric.”

Many residents, however, claimed that the septuagenarian may have been killed due to series of litigations he had before the court.

“What I can say is that the man is a troublesome man who loves fighting everybody. I know that he has a lot of matter in various courts. We cannot rule out this in his killing, but God knows best.

“Chief Okuneye is well known in Ijebu-Igbo and neighbouring towns. He was among the first generation artisans who specialised in furniture making in Ijebu area,” a resident, who did not want his name mentioned, said.

The late septuagenarian, whose body has been deposited at the mortuary of the general hospital in Ijebu-Igbo, left behind six wives and over 20 children."

Gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members stormed a packed viewing centre in Yobe State and shot dead two people watching Champions League matches, police said Thursday.

The centre was showing the two quarter-final matches between defending champions Bayern Munich and Manchester United and Atletico Madrid and Barcelona, on Wednesday when it was attacked. “The gunmen came in a car and opened fire outside the viewing centre and sped off,” Yobe State police commissioner Sanusi Rufa’i told AFP of the incident in Potiskum, a hotbed of the insurgency.

“One person died on the spot while another died later at the hospital. Several other people were injured, some critically,” he added.

Residents said the centre was full at the time, with those who could not get a space inside hanging around the windows to watch the second-leg games, which saw Bayern and Atletico reaching the last four.

Rufa’i did not directly blame Boko Haram for the attack but the hardline group has been known for preaching against football as part of its agenda to impose strict Islamic law in northern Nigeria.

In several video clips, Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, had described football and music as a Western ploy to distract Muslims from their religion.

In April 2012, gunmen killed two men at a viewing centre in Potiskum, days after Boko Haram warned people in leaflets to stay away from such centres and calling for such places to be closed.

Football is Nigeria’s national sport and the country’s national team, the Super Eagles, are the reigning African champions.

English Premier League football is wildly popular, with many Nigerians supporting top clubs such as Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool, whose matches are shown live on television.

By James Sowole

One Bosun Adegorola was Wednesday shot dead when crisis erupted during the ward congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akure, the Ondo State capital.

This came as two of the three political parties that formed APC, the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) yesterday dissociated themselves from the rescheduled ward congresses of the party in the state.

Adegorola was said to have been shot during an argument at Isikan Ward II in Akure South Local Government.

When THISDAY got to the scene of the incident in front of Midee Lounge at Ajipowo area of the state capital, residents were not willing to volunteer any information.

However, the blood stains were seen at the scene in front of the relaxation centre while the gate of the relaxation centre and shops around the place were locked.

It was learnt that the incident occurred when some leaders of the party including the Interim Secretary, Prince Olu Adegboro asked two rival aspirants to go outside the venue to consult with the aim of making one to step down for the other.

A source said as soon as the two aspirants went outside, some people emerged from nowhere and shot sporadically into the air.

The gunshots caused pandemonium and the deceased was hit on the head and fell down immediately.

He was then rushed to the emergency unit of the State Specialist Hospital, Akure.

However, all efforts to save the life of Adogorola proved abortive as he died minutes later.

Confirming the incident, the Deputy Police Public Relations Officer for Ondo State Command, Mr Lawal Opeyemi, said three suspects had been arrested.

Lawal said the command had begun investigation into the incidents.

Apart from the Isikan Ward II incident, the congress did not end well in some other areas in the state capital.

At Isolo/Oshodi ward 10, election did not take place as there were different factions of the party who failed to reach compromise over accreditation of their members The members alleged that a member of the National Assembly, was planning to manipulate the outcome of the congress in his favour.

According to one of the party member, the lawmaker action was to have the structure of the party in Akure South in his pocket which was opposed by some other prominent members of the party.

They said the lawmaker group opposed accreditation of members after mobilising hoodlums from other wards to come and vote in Isolo/ Oshodi ward 10.

The people at the congress resisted the idea and insisted on proper process which led to pandemonium while members of the party deserted the venue of the congress.

Meanwhile, the decision of the legacy parties to pull out of the congress was contained in a statement signed by the quartet of a member of Board of Trustees of the defunct ANPP, Capt Demola Ariyo, state Chairman of defunct ANPP, Chief Yemisi Aladesaye, state Chairman of the defunct CPC, Mr. Olalekan Obolo and governorship candidate of the defunct CPC, Mr. Soji Ehinlanwo.

The aggrieved parties said the decision was taken due to an alleged marginalisation of members of the party and some members of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).

They therefore called for more credible local, state and national convention billed for April 12 and 23 as well as May 24 respectively.

In a statement signed by a member, they called for “a more credible congress which will accommodate all shades of interest in Ondo State APC,” stressing that “APC belongs to all of us and not only to a small group of egocentric politicians.”

The statement read: “Having consulted widely with our members and supporters across Ondo State, we wish to disassociate ourselves from the ongoing congresses organised by a faction of the APC in the state.

“We wish to state for the avoidance of doubt that this decision is predicated on the fact that our members across Ondo State have been marginalised not only during the last membership registration exercise but also in the process leading up to this sham congresses.

“We therefore wish to assure all our members and supporters that the party APC belongs to all of us and not only to a small group of egocentric politicians.

“As a result, we enjoin them to remain calm even in the face of the usurpation of their rights and privileges, while they are advised to await directives very soon for a more credible congress which will accommodate all shades of interests in Ondo State APC.”

However, a chieftain of the party, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the congress would go as scheduled, describing those grumbling as jokers.

He said any person that has the interest of the party at heart would do everything possible to ensure the growth of the party and not to struggle for position.

Meanwhile, an aide of Governor Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State, Mr. Agharese Idubor, yesterday led no fewer than 150 registered members of the APC in Benin City to pitch their tents with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to protest the way and manner the ward congresses were conducted in the state.

The defecting APC members are from Ward 7 in the Egor Local Government Area of Edo South senatorial district. Edo, Idubor is the Executive Director, Protocol Matters to the governor.

The aide, who spoke on behalf of the defecting members, said their decision to return to the PDP was borne out of the alleged political betrayal of the leadership of APC in the state at the ward congress in the state on Tuesday.

According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), he argued that leadership positions should be attained through election and not by imposition “as was witnessed by APC members on Tuesday.’’

Idubor took a swipe at the leaders of the party in the state “whose roles in the just-concluded ward congress negated the principle of the one-man-one vote’’ policy of the party.

He said that leadership and governance were not about the acquisition of powers to oppress others “but to be used to better the lots of citizenry through people-oriented policies.’’

He pledged the loyalty of the new members to the leadership structure of PDP in the state, saying they were impressed with the existing internal democracy of the party in the state.

Idubor said they would strive to work for the party and ensure its victory in the general elections in 2015 and state governorship election in 2016.

Receiving the members, the Chairman of the PDP in Edo, Chief Dan Orbih, said their decision to join the PDP was apt in view of the “APC’s shameful ward congress.’’

A scene of Boko Haram attack

Men believed to be members of the Boko Haram sect have again invaded the Borno villages of Ngoshe and Kaigamari, in Gwoza and Konduga Local Government Areas, respectively, killing 38 people.

The insurgents also set ablaze several houses and shops in addition to destroying mobile telecommunications masts in the area.

Ngoshe is located east of hilly Gwoza town, between Cameroon border with Nigeria, while Kaigamari is a remote settlement in Konduga, a town which has always been under the siege of the Boko Haram terrorists.

Gwoza is about 140 kilometres south, while Konduga is 40 kilometres drive from Maiduguri, the state capital.

It was gathered from a source that “the gunmen, armed with Improvised Explosive Devices, petrol bombs, AK 47 rifles and rocket propelled grenades invaded Ngoshe at about 10pm on Saturday and opened fire on the already sleeping and unarmed residents, killing 30 of them and inflicting injuries on several others, before setting ablaze some houses.”

Also in Kaigamari, no fewer than eight people were said to have been killed on Sunday when another set of gunmen attacked the village and torched some houses and shops.

An eyewitness, who said he was lucky to escape the attack in Ngoshe, Mallam Usman Jidda, told journalists in Maiduguri that the gunmen who were sighted some few days back in between the mountainous areas of Ngoshe and Limankara villages had a field day killing and destroying houses without being challenged by security operatives in the area.

“I thank God for sparing my life and those of the members of my family as we were able to escape the attack, we are now settling with one of my relatives in Gwoza council area. I can confirm to you that more than 30 people were killed by the insurgents in Ngoshe, apart from the destruction of property worth millions of naira,” Jidda stated.

The attack in Kaigamari village near the state capital was said to have forced surviving residents to flee the area to Maiduguri on Sunday.

The insurgents were also said to have attacked Hamsa in Gwoza Hills in Borno State.

Investigations revealed that the attackers came to the besieged area through Kwatara and encamped against the community at Tate.

The source said that the “operation started around 5pm on Saturday and lasted all through the night.”

Although, the source could not give the casualty figure in the latest attacks, it was stated that a relative of the leader of the Church of Christ in Nations in the area was among the dead.

But the Director of Defence Information, Maj.-Gen. Chris Olukolade, said on the telephone on Sunday that the operation to flush out the insurgents in the Gwoza hills was still ongoing.

He stated that the area was very vast as it extends to Adamawa State and Cameroon.

He said, “The operation to flush out the insurgents is still going on; that place is very vast, the Special Forces have taken over a part of the hill; you know that it extends to Adamawa and, Cameroon…”

However, Olukolade said in a statement on Sunday that several makeshift insurgents’ camps in the forest and mountains had been dislodged in ongoing ground and aerial bombardments

He stated that the security forces had noted the “presence of unarmed members of terrorist groups in some villages.”

He said that the Special Forces had been directed to ensure aggressive patrol of local communities to complement the ongoing assault on the insurgents.

Meanwhile, the Sultan of Sokoto and President General of the Jama’atu Nasril Islam, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar lll, lamented on Sunday that the killings in the country under the guise of insurgency was spreading at an alarming rate.

The sultan, who spoke at the 50th Anniversary Lecture of the JNI in Kaduna on Sunday, asked the Federal Government to curb the ugly development.

He said, “We have discussed with government on the National Conference and how to make it a success. We don’t want another jamboree, we have been giving advice to our leaders it is left for them to take the advice or jettison them.

“Everyday we hear of people killed in different parts of the country. It is a nightmare that is spreading to parts of the country in the name of cattle rustling. We are worried about the Muslims, Christians and Fulani being killed because life is sacred.

“Why are we fighting one another in the name of ethnicity and religion; we should all go about our religion peacefully. Our non-Muslim brothers should join us to look at problems bedeviling the country and find solutions,” he said.

The Vice President, Namadi Sambo, assured that the Federal Government was doing all it could to arrest the ugly trend.

Sambo promised that the perceived imbalance raised by the Sultan would be addressed, noting that the government would ensure fairness and equity in all its dealings with Nigerians irrespective of religion.

Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Borno State, Alhaji Lawal Tanko, said no candidate for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination on Saturday was killed in the state.

Tanko was reacting to an online report that 200 candidates were killed in one of the centres in Maiduguri by suspected Boko Haram insurgents.

He told the News Agency of Nigeria that “I was directly in charge of the police operations to ensure safety of the candidates in all the examination venues in Maiduguri.”

FIVE suspected kidnappers were shot dead yesterday by the police in Edo state during a gun duel with the suspects.

This comes as the Edo State Police Commissioner, Mr Funso Adebanjo raised an alarm that armed bandits and kidnappers are succeeding in Nigeria because Nigerians are not giving useful information to the police.

Saturday Vanguard learnt that the kidnappers who abducted a female victim and took her to a forest at Oluku along the Benin-Akure road, met their waterloo when detectives stormed the area at the early hours of yesterday.

The notorious kidnappers were said to have laid ambush for the detectives who stormed the area with a decoy vehicle and a Volkswagen Santana car. They rained bullets at the police officers who eventually took cover and responded abruptly. The names of the suspects were given as Smart Uche, Jerry M, Osarumwen Ekibise, Lucky Ekhator and Osai Friday.

Other suspects were said to have escaped into the forest with bullet wounds while the police continued combing the forest. According to Commissioner Adebanjo, “while combing the forest, we recovered one Pump Action gun, forty three cartridges, double barrel gun, one black Range Rover jeep with registration number BDG 335 BD snatched from their victim.

“Presently, operatives of the command have embarked on cordon and searching of the forest for the eventual arrest of other notorious members who fled with bullet wounds”. CP Balogun who stressed the need for members of the public to give the police information, asserted that “we cannot fight crime successfully without information. Nigerians must stop this habit of thinking that the police alone can provide security for you.

“These criminals are succeeding because we don’t give information about them and that is the problem we have in Nigeria. We may have all the equipment in the world to fight crime but if you don’t give the police useful information, nothing will change” he stated.

The attack is coming barely 25 days after unknown gunmen attacked the Government Girl’s Secondary School Yana in Shira Local Government Area of the state in which a five-year old girl was burnt to death and staff quaters, the school bus and an eight-man block rank and file quarters were all burnt down.

Other facilities attacked were the Yana branch of First Bank and large sums of money carted away, MTN, Glo and Etisalat Telecommunication masts were also destroyed.

The spokesperson for the Bauchi State Police Command, DSP Haruna Mohammed, in a statement in Bauchi, said no death was recorded during the over one hour attack.

“On May 14, 2014 between 10 and 11pm, unknown gunmen went on the rampage and burnt down Shadarki and Yelwan Darazo Primary Schools in Shadarki village in Darazo Local Government Area of Bauchi State,” Mohammed said.

The PPRO added that the gunmen also burnt down one MTN Mast Site T.1137 and the surveillance monitoring site located adjacent to the mast.

He said the entire surroundings had been cordoned off by the combined security forces and efforts were being intensified to arrest the suspects.

Also, the Bauchi State Police Command has confirmed that suspected Fulani ambushed and attacked a car in Bogoro Local Government Area of the state killing one person and injuring five passengers including the driver.

The PPRO confirmed this in a statement on Thursday.

“On May 14, 2014 at about 7.45pm, hoodlums attacked a Peugeot 806 vehicle with registration Number XA.06.BGR while returning from Bogoro Market along Kurum Dodo and Gobiya.

“As a result, a motor-cycle rider identified as Bogoro Tafiya Mwari, ‘M’ was hacked to death while the driver, one Isaiah Andrawus and four others, sustained various degrees of injuries,” Mohammed stated.

He said some of the victims were rushed to Bogoro General Hospital and Jos University Teaching Hospital for treatment.

He said three expended ammunition of 7.62mm were recovered at the scene.

The police spokesperson said that investigation into the incidence had commenced and efforts were on to arrest the fleeing suspects.

It was also gathered that but for the quick intervention of the Sayawa elders and Special Task Force (STF) in the area, angry youths would have lynched the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the Local Government, Mr. Simon Bukata, during the burial of the deceased.

The youths upon seeing Bukata, at the venue of the burial, were said to have quickly mobilised and rushed to attack him but were immediately stopped by the STF and the elders.

This was as gunmen invaded the palace of the suspended Edemo, Chief Bamidele Aduloju, on Wednesday night and yesterday morning, compelling him to take refuge at a police station in the city.

It was gathered that the armed youths, who had stormed the Edemo’s palace in the late hours of Wednesday and also resurfaced in the early hours of yesterday, shot sporadically into the air and attacked people on sight, thus leaving some people injured.

The crisis with land and chieftaincy dimensions, which has been on since last year, erupted again last week, following the installation by the monarch of Dayo Fajemilua as Edemo, a step which youths of the Odo Ado area protested, saying such was unacceptable and unheard of.

One of Aduloju’s sons, Sunday, who told journalists that he was with his father when the attack occurred, said: “We were going for a meeting when we saw over 40 armed men marching towards our palace and by the time we were going back home, we heard sporadic gunshots coming from our compound. I had to take my father to Okesa Police Station. In short, that was where he slept.”

He added that the armed men returned to his father’s palace yesterday morning when they wanted to return home, thus compelling his father to go to the police headquarters to report the matter.

According to him, the incident was not unconnected with the refusal of his father to trade the family land in Ago Aduloju, Ado-Ikare road, adding that his father had told the Ewi (monarch) that he would not allow ineligible people to take over its possession."

Members of a vigilante group in Madagali, a town in Adamawa State, have killed more than 70 Boko Haram members and and handed over seven captured militants to the police.

The vigilantes acted after they were tipped off by a local food vendor that the militants were coming to get food before heading out for a major operation to raid villages in the area, usually carried out at night.

The vigilant group mobilized, laid ambush and waited patiently for the militants, a source in the village disclosed. The source added that as soon as the Islamist insurgents numbering more than 100 showed up in the village to pick up their favorite meals, the vigilantes attacked them, killing most of them in a hail of bullets.

Today's attack is the second time this week that local vigilantes would defeat the rampaging militants. The first time was two days ago when well-armed vigilantes in Kalabalge, Borno State, ambushed a squad of Boko Haram militants.

A security source told SaharaReporters that Nigerians resident in many remote areas of the Northeast seem to have decided that the best way to repel incessant attacks by murderous gangs of Boko Haram insurgents was to take matters into their own hands.

A vigilante member involved in today's ambush told our local correspondent that Nigerian soldiers appear unable or unwilling to wage an effective war against the insurgents. ""They (soldiers) seem to be helpless and to fear the Boko Haram warriors who terrorize us here. But we are not afraid. They are men like us. And we are tired of folding up our hands and allowing them to kill us, to kill our wives and to kill our children.""

In the early hours of Saturday, gunmen in their large numbers attacked a quiet agrarian village, Dalwa-Masuba in Damboa local area of the state, killing 40 people, injuring several others and torching the entire community.

The gunmen had also burnt down three pickup vans carrying woods to Damboa.

A member of the security vigilante, who spoke to LEADERSHIP Sunday on phone on condition of anonymity, said no security personnel had reached the attacked town at the time he was speaking.

""We heard about the attack from some of the villagers who fled the village, and we had to drive there on our patrol van; the entire village was set on fire, and about 40 persons were lying dead all over the place; three firewood pickups were also set ablaze,"" the local vigilante said.

The attack which occurred within the morning hours has not been confirmed by the police and other security operatives yet.

Dalwa-Masuba is a farming community 40km away from Damboa town and about 80km south-west of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.

Another attack was reported some hours earlier along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway. Boko Haram attacked and killed nine people and escaped with a vehicle loaded with beans.

Witnesses said the incident happened about 6pm on Friday.

A lucky bus driver whose three passengers were not so lucky said he did not notice the attackers until he ran into them while operating on the highway. He managed to escape but three of his passengers died of bullet wounds fired by the attackers.

Relating his story to newsmen, the driver who was in tears said, ""I failed to notice that people in the nearby village were stopping me. The attackers shot at my vehicle and killed three people. The rest of us were lucky to have escaped.""

The gunmen, according to a witness, had engaged some of the soldiers in the nearby checkpost, but still managed to escape with the lorry filled with about 150 bags of beans.

If not for the arrival of the soldiers and the gunmen decided to escape with the bags of beans, many more people would have been killed.

Though police officials in the state did not respond to calls and text messages sent for confirmation of the incident, some junior policemen who were aware of the attacks confirmed the incident when they spoke with our reporter off the record.

When contacted, director of Defence Information, Major General Chris Olukolade confirmed that there was an attack along Benisheikh.

However, Olukolade could not confirm the number of those who lost their lives in the attack.

""Yes there was an attack along Damaturu road and some soldiers were wounded in the process of repealing the attack.

But Boko Haram insurgents have suffered another setback as local vigilante ambushed them and killed dozens of them in Madagali local government area of Adamawa State.

A source in Madagali said the incident took place when a suspected Boko Haram member driving in a Hilux van purchased foodstuff from a local market and was trailed to a hideout in the bush by members of the vigilante who later mobilized and launched an audacious attack on their enclave.

The source added that, before the attack, soldiers were also informed, leading to the formation of a strong alliance that faced the insurgents.

The ambush led to the killing of dozens of the insurgents while many weapons were recovered after hours of gun duel.

""After a tip-off that the insurgents set up a camp in Madagali from where they could launch attacks, we contacted the military and mobilised our vigilante to intercept them. The combined effort of soldiers and the vigilante led to the killing of 90 Boko Haram fighters,"" he said.

The official added that ""seven soldiers including Captain Akintola and the commanding officer of 123 battalion also lost their lives in the gun battle which took place between Bita and Jaji in Madagali area just on the border with Borno State"".

Hospital sources told our correspondent that corpses of the slain soldiers were deposited at the Federal Medical Centre, Yola, on Wednesday and Thursday.

However, the police PPRO in Adamawa, Usman Muhammad, said the incident did not take place in Adamawa. ""Our investigation reveals that the incident did not happen in Adamawa but in Borno State. The root of the event started in Adamawa when a person suspected to be a member came to Madagali Market to purchase large stock of food,"" he said. ""The people having marked him as a suspect began to trail his movement up to Borno State where he came from... and they launched the attack on them.""

When contacted on phone, the spokesman of the 23rd Armoured Brigade, Yola, Captain Nuhu Jafar, said he was busy attending to some official duties and promised to call back, but he did not.

... Europe, Africa declare war on sect

The Paris summit for security in Nigeria put together by French president François Hollande held yesterday in France with Cameroun, Chad, Niger, Benin Republic and representatives of the United States, United Kingdom and European Union agreeing to team up with Nigeria against the Boko Haram insurgents.

While agreeing to tackle the violent group as a regional threat not only to Africa, the countries also decided to map out strategies that include instituting sanctions against Boko Haram within the framework of the United Nations. It also agreed to share information and mobilize funds in support of women and girls in marginalized and threatened communities.

President Goodluck Jonathan also used the summit to clarify why he shelved his planned visit to Chibok community in Borno State, saying it was not necessary for him to visit the place where over 200 girls were abducted from Government Secondary School since the girls were not in the school.

While noting that he had visited such sites before, President Jonathan however said the case of Chibok was different since there was nobody in the school. He added that while his service chiefs had already visited Chibok, what was incumbent was the rescue of the girls and not his visit.

Insisting that his interest was to locate and rescue the girls, Jonathan said, ""These girls are not held in Chibok. Sometimes, people want the president to go to Chibok. If the president goes to Chibok today, it does not solve any problem. The problem facing the president and indeed the Nigerian government is how to get these girls from wherever they are.""

The president, who noted that the allegation of misappropriation of funds by the military was being exaggerated, acknowledged that administrative lapses might have been responsible for the inadequate funding of the fight against insurgency.

He said Nigerian soldiers were being trained to develop the capacity to effectively combat terrorism, though there are still challenges because terrorism is a relatively new phenomenon in Nigeria.

Earlier at the summit, President Jonathan told world leaders that the Boko Haram sect had so far killed 12,000 people and 8,000 injured in Nigeria.

""This unconventional war has so far claimed over 12, 000 lives, with more than 8, 000 persons injured or maimed, not to mention the displacement of thousands of innocent Nigerians,"" he said.

While delivering his speech, Jonathan noted that Boko Haram, being hostile to democracy, uses every means to indoctrinate its members with an ultimate objective to destabilize the country ""and take over Nigeria in order to turn it into a base of operation in West Africa and the entire continent"".

""Since 2009, we have had to contend with many attacks and killings, which have now developed into a full-scale war targeting the stability and integrity of our nation. Boko Haram has launched a vicious guerrilla-style campaign against the government and the people of Nigeria. It has attacked schools, slaughtered students in their dormitories, destroyed villages, communities and government infrastructure and has wreaked havoc on the economic and social life of our people,"" he noted.

Jonathan declared: ""At the international level, we should take concrete steps to designate the Al Qaeda in West Africa, alias Boko Haram, as a terrorist organisation on the basis of the Proscription Order that my government has already imposed on the organisation.

""We should also accelerate the implementation of other international sanctions, particularly under the auspices of the United Nations, on Boko Haram, Ansaru and their principal leaders.""

Noting that Nigeria was working relentlessly to expose the sponsors of Boko Haram, the president said, ""We are already making thorough intelligence efforts to identify their sponsors and their sources of funding and arms supply. I have no doubt that with the cooperation of Nigeria's neighbours, it would be possible to rein in these organisations until this scourge is ultimately eliminated and defeated. We will not succumb to terrorists and their dangerous tactics.

""Terrorists will not be allowed to define who we are or instil fear in our people and cause destruction and mayhem. The time has therefore come for all peace-loving peoples of the world to unite against this new threat to global peace and stability.""

After the summit presided over by the French president, Nigeria and its neighbouring countries agreed to build analysis and response capabilities that will contribute to enhancing the security of all populations and the rule of law in the areas affected by Boko Haram's terrorist acts.

A communiqué issued at the end of the meeting notes that, in order to combat the insurgents' threat ""which manifested itself through several murderous attacks and the abduction of more than 270 schoolgirls, Nigeria and its neighbours have decided to implement coordinated patrols with the aim of combating Boko Haram and locating the Chibok girls"".

They also agreed to establish a system to pool intelligence in order to support this operation, establish mechanisms for information exchange on trafficking of weapons and bolster measures to secure weapons' stockpiles while also establishing mechanism for border surveillance.

According to the communiqué, the countries are to establish an intelligence pooling unit, create a dedicated team to identify means of implementation and draw up, during a second phase, a regional counter-terrorism strategy in the framework of the Lake Chad Basin Commission.

It states: ""The United States, the United Kingdom, France and the European Union will coordinate their support for this regional cooperation through technical expertise, training programmes and support for the border area management programmes.

""The participants committed to accelerating the implementation of international sanctions against Boko Haram, Ansaru and their main leaders, within the United Nations framework as a priority.

""France, US, Britain and the European Union pledged to mobilize donors in support of programmes fostering social economic development of the regions concerned with particular emphasis on gender equality and the rights of women and girls.The participants agreed that the United Kingdom would host a follow-up meeting next month at ministerial level to review progress on this action plan.""

The leaders of Nigeria's neighbours - Benin, Cameroon, Niger and Chad - as well as representatives from the United States, United Kingdom and European Union attended the summit to discuss fresh strategies for dealing with the security threat posed by Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in West and Central Africa.

President Jonathan arrived Elysee Palace at 11:55am local time and was received by his host, President Hollande.

They were later joined by presidents Mahamadou Issoufou (Niger Republic), Boni Yaya (Benin Republic), Paul Biya (Cameroon) and Idriss Deby Itno (Chad) as well as US under-secretary of state Wendy Sherman, British foreign affairs secretary William Hague and European Union representative Herman Van Rompuy.

The chief of defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, and the national security adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd), were invited to the meeting about one hour after its commencement.

Hollande had on Friday discussed the issue of the rescue of the Chibok girls in a phone conversation with US president Barack Obama. The US, which says it considers the safe return of the girls as one of its priorities, already has its specialist teams and drones searching the Sambisa forest.

The US had criticized the perceived slow response of the federal government to the abduction of the schoolgirls by Boko Haram with US Air Force chief of staff Gen. Mark Welsh III who testified on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying that the Nigerian military was afraid of the insurgents.

APC govs to rebuild Chibok school

The chairman, Governors' Forum of the All Progressives Congress, Rochas Okorocha, has announced that governors of the party would rebuild the secondary school in Chibok where the girls were abducted by Boko Haram insurgents 36 days ago.

He stated this yesterday when the Nigerian Guild of Editors paid him a courtesy call at the Government House, Owerri.

Okorocha, while reacting to the warning of the Guild to politicians who have hijacked the situation of the girls and other security challenges in the country, said that his party would be at the forefront to condemn such a person, just as he added that all political parties should work in harmony to rescue the country from its present predicament.

""Many have attributed Nigeria's problem to hunger and other things , but Nigeria is going through trying times. APC, PDP should close ranks and see how to rescue the country,"" Okorocha said.

The resolve of the APC governors to rebuild the burnt school is coming on the heels of an aborted visit by President Jonathan who had already made preparations to visit the community on Friday. Even though the Presidency denied the ""rumour"" of the visit, the fact that the president's advance party was sighted in Maiduguri punctured holes in the denials.

Earlier in his speech , the Guild's president , Femi Adesina, said they were in the state for its second quota standing committee meeting. He cautioned politicians against playing politics with such a serious issue as security .

In particular, he warned that the insurgency in the nation is enough woe to give everybody a lot of concern, saying that "" security issues should not be mixed with politics"".

Adesina also praised Governor Okorocha for his laudable achievements in the state."

The sect also abducted five policemen and seized the Armoured Patrol Vehicle (APC) the policemen were using.

This is even as a Chinese national was feared killed and 10 others kidnapped after an overnight attack by the sect in Kuseri village between Gamboru Ngala council area and Cameroon Republic, also yesterday.

In one of the attacks, at least 40 villagers were killed and several others injured yesterday’s evening by gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members in Dalwa-Masuba village of Damboa Local Government area of Borno State, security sources and witnesses said.

The gunmen who were reported to have attacked the villages in their large numbers also burnt down the entire village alongside three pickup vans carrying firewood from Damboa to Maiduguri, the state capital.

A member of the security vigilantes, Abbas Gava, who spoke on phone, said no security personnel had reached the attacked town at the time he was speaking.

“We heard about the attack from some of the villagers who fled the village, and we had to drive there on our patrol van. The entire village was set on fire, and about 40 persons were lying dead all over the place; their firewood pickups were also set ablaze”, the local vigilante said.

But the attack, however, has not been confirmed by the police and other security operatives, as all their phone numbers could not be reached for confirmation as at press time.

In the same vein, about 16 people were killed, five policemen abducted or are still missing and the Armoured Patrol Vehicle (APC) they were using seized in separate attacks by insurgents at the Bama-Banki T- junction road, in Bama and Beneshiekh council areas of Borno State.

The missing/abducted policemen, according to investigation by our correspondent, are Inspector Luka Maina, Sergeant Manya Chaka, Corporals Hassan Dauda, Emmanuel Onoche and Umar Ali.

“Boko Haram Islamists attacked a camp of road workers. A Chinese was killed. 10 Chinese cannot be found since the attack. We think they have probably been kidnapped,” a local police officer who pleaded anonymity also informed.

Our correspondent gathered from reliable sources that the Banki incident took place on Friday at about 9:50 am when some policemen attached to Banki Division were attacked by some group of terrorists while they were trying to drop six of them at the junction’s road; the men were to proceed to their promotion course examination and interview.

Another source said: “Five policemen attached to Banki, a border town with Bama and Cameroon Republic were attacked by Boko Haram. The terrorists opened fire on the APC numbered NPF4960c conveying the policemen led by an Inspector and five others. The policemen quickly rushed out of the APC and ran into the bush before the terrorists went away with the abandoned APC. As I am talking to you now (Saturday), the whereabouts of the policemen are yet to be known and we are suspecting that the terrorists might have kidnapped or killed them”.

The Borno Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tanko Lawan, only confirmed the abduction of the five policemen and the seizing of the APC vehicle by the terrorists, even though, he was economical with details.

“Yes it happened, but give me two minutes; I will call you back because right now I am attending to some visitors,” Tanko said at press time.

In a related and unconfirmed development, sources said some gunmen attacked Ngubdala village near Ngurosoye community in Bama Local Government area of the state, killing many residents. But a reliable security officer said what happened was that some group of terrorists suspected to be those who attacked and abducted six policemen along Bama – Banki axis fired several shots around Ngubdala/ Ngurosoye village while fleeing after the attack.

“We have sent our men to the mentioned village and the information we received was that there was nobody or resident that was killed, only that, residents of Ngubdala and Ngurosoye had a sleepless night on Friday when some gunmen fired several shots around their community while trying to escape after an attack. The two villages are very close to where some terrorists seized one of our APC vehicles,” the security officer who pleaded anonymity said.

Likewise, suspected members of the Boko Haram sect on Friday killed nine people at a spot along the Maiduguri- Damaturu road and also seized a vehicle loaded with beans, while other six out of the 27 persons injured died while receiving treatment at one of the hospitals in Maiduguri.

Witnesses and credible security sources said an unspecified number of gun-wielding men ambushed motorists at a deserted location between Mainok and Benisheik and killed nine people at the spot.

It was gathered that the attackers stopped some vehicles and killed the occupants around 6pm before they were engaged by troops from nearby villages.

A bus driver going to Maiduguri from Damaturu said he rammed into the assailants but refused to stop.

“I failed to notice that people in the nearby village were stopping me. The attackers shot at my vehicle and killed three people. The rest of us were lucky to have escaped,” he said.

Another source said the insurgents snatched a lorry loaded with about 150 bags of beans and drove it into the bush without a trace."

No impact on our operations –NNPC

No fewer than seven persons were feared dead following an explosion that rocked the Port Harcourt Refinery Jetty at Okrika, in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State yesterday.

It was gathered that vandals had tampered with one of the pipelines of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, at a jetty near Okrika, leading to an explosion.

Although the casualty figure was put at seven by sources, it was learnt that scores of people were said to have suffered severe burns.

A staff of the refinery, who did not want his name mentioned, said at least seven persons were burnt as a result of the explosion, adding that most of them were vandals siphoning oil after bursting a pipeline.

The source added that those who suffered severe burns were taken to an undisclosed hospital for treatment.

The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tunde Ogunsakin, confirmed the explosion to National Mirror. He said that the fire was as a result of the activities of oil pipeline vandals.

Also, the Chairman, Okrika Local Government Area, Tamunu Williams, confirmed that the incident was as a result of vandals trying to siphon oil.

Williams said: “The fire incident is as a result of oil thieves who were siphoning oil from NNPC pipelines. As you can see, there is no management staff of the NNPC or persons in-charge of the corporation’s operations here.

“The gates of the NNPC remain closed to visitors, so, we have not seen anybody that we can officially complain to.

“I am speaking from the gate of the NNPC and I have been advised to come on Monday when the officials of the NNPC who are incharge here will be on the ground. The number of casualties cannot be properly ascertained as I speak due to the nature of the terrain within and around the jetty.

“Those who survived were said to have been severely burnt. A lot of things are shrouded in secrecy. We have seen the fire but the NNPC has not giving us permission to go in and verify the enormity of the damage.

“The security there is intensive, yet no NNPC staff wants to speak with us. Since they are not ready to go, we chose to go there ourselves. There are, indeed, casualties, but the number of casualties we cannot really confirm. We have been to the creek and we saw the pipelines connections.”

Williams appealed to the management of NNPC to provide adequate protection and security for their pipelines and equipment so as not to endanger the lives of the people of Okrika.

“From what we saw, there is negligence on the part of the NNPC in the maintenance of their equipment. Their equipment and pipes are in a state of disrepair. NNPC should take time to invest in the maintenance of their equipment,” he added.

Spokesman of the Port Harcourt Refinery, Mr. Ralph Ugwu, however, said the fire did not affect the operations of the company, stressing that the refinery was up and running; even as he blamed the incident on vandals.

“The refinery is up and running. We are receiving products and PMM from the jetty too. No member of staff of NNPC or Port Harcourt Refinery was affected in the fire. The situation has no impact on our operations at all.

“What happened was that vandals came to siphon oil and it resulted in fire. It is not in my place to mention any casualty figure because it happened outside our jurisdiction,” Ugwu said."

It will be recalled that about two weeks ago the outlawed sect attacked Gamboru Ngala, a border town with Cameroon, killing about 300 persons and destroying million of Naira worth of property.

It was gathered that some suspected members of the Boko Haram sect, laid ambush on the village on Wednesday morning.

The attack, according to a resident, Mallam Bakura Mustapha, occurred barely 10 days after the withdrawal of troops from the village.

Sources said the gunmen drove into the village in 15 vehicles and several motorcycles and were armed with AK47 rifles, Improvised Explosive Devices and petrol bombs.

It was gathered that they stormed the village at about 11am on Wednesday and opened fire on armless residents killing 29 people and burnt many buildings.

Another source said, apart from those killed, there were several injuries sustained and many residents of the village who sustained gunshot wounds “are now receiving treatment at one of a hospital in Cameroon Republic.”

Efforts to get the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Gideon Jubrin, to comment on the attack failed, but a top security source who is not authorised to speak to the press, confirmed the incident.

More than 30 people were killed in the attacks overnight into Friday in north-eastern Borno state, they said.

The raids took place as the UN Security Council approved sanctions against the Islamist group.

It is five weeks since Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls, prompting international outrage.

Nigerian officials say President Goodluck Jonathan is due to travel to South Africa for discussions with other African heads of state on combating terrorism in Africa following on from last weekend’s summit hosted by France.

Earlier his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, said African presidents should take responsibility for their failures and resolve their own conflicts together.

“I find that our leaders, who should have been working together all along to address these problems that only affect their countries, wait until they are invited to go to Europe. Why does anybody wait for that? What image does it even give about Africa?” he said.

Residents from two of the villages that came under attack said militants had arrived in a convoy and gathered the men of the community together.

They accused them of being members of vigilante groups and killed them all, one villager from Moforo in Marte district who escaped across the border to Cameroon told the BBC Hausa service.

They then burnt down all the shops in the market, leaving the villagers destitute, he said.

Correspondents say that most villages have formed vigilante groups to try to protect their communities from militant attacks.

A resident of Kimbi village in Biu district said the villagers contacted the security forces to alert them to their attack, but were told it was not an area under military control so they could not be helped.

The military has not commented on the allegation.

About 25 men were killed in Moforo, another eight men in Kimbi. It is not known if there were casualties from a raid early on Friday on Kabrihu village near the Sambisa forest.

The latest attacks came after another deadly village raid in Borno and twin bombings which killed 122 in the central city of Jos on Tuesday. The authorities also suspect Boko Haram of being behind those attacks, but there has so far been no claim of responsibility from the group.

Boko Haram was added to the UN Security Council’s al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee’s list of designated entities on Thursday at the request of Nigeria.

US envoy Samantha Power said it was an “important step” in support of efforts to “defeat Boko Haram and hold its murderous leadership accountable”."

There was pandemonium in the community as hell was let loose as members of the All Progressives Congress and the LP clashed.

One person was shot with several cars, including the Outside Broadcast Van of the African Independent Television, Ekiti station, vandalised.

In the ensuing melee, dangerous weapons like guns, machetes, broken bottles were freely used, while several members of the two parties and three of the AIT crew members were wounded.

It was gathered that three of the V-sat cameras belonging to AIT were stolen out of which one has been recovered.

The two parties have, however, blamed each other for the attack.

While the Media aide to Bamidele, Mr. Ahmed Salami, accused the APC of being responsible for the attacks, the ruling party in the state said it was the LP members that launched attacks on their members, leading to the violence.

Salami claimed that the event had already ended and the Ondo Governor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, and the National Chairman of the party, Dan Nwanyanwu, had left for the palace of Ogoga of Ikere Ekiti, Oba Samuel Adegboye, when a bus, loaded with thugs, invaded the venue of the rally and started attacking the LP members.

He said, “Dr Mimiko and members of our party had already wrapped up the rally when thugs numbering 30 invaded the venue. They knew that the police had left the venue and our people had no protection.

“They shot into the air sporadically and many of our members had to run into the bush after many had been attacked with machetes and beaten by APC thugs.”

Salami alleged that men and officers attached to the Ikere Divisional Police Station watched helplessly as thugs attacked their members.

But the spokesperson for the Kayode Fayemi Campaign Organisation, Mr. Dimeji Daniels, claimed it was the LP members that launched attacks on their members.

He disclosed that a member of the APC, Otunba Femi Ayodele, was in a critical situation at the Ekiti State Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, as a result of the gunshot wound he sustained during the violence.

Denying involvement of their members in the violence, Daniels said the APC could not have been responsible for the attack because the party was holding a meeting as of the time the attack happened.

The KFCO, which sympathised with the journalists, said it was unreasonable to attack harmless newsmen whose major job was to serve as the voice for the voiceless.

Daniels said, “I don’t think it is possible for APC to shoot another APC person, so the LP is responsible for the violence. What they did was that, they were attacking our members who were just going on the streets and that was what caused the crisis.

“They did not only attack us, they went to APC secretariat in Ikere Ekiti and brought out all the furniture and burnt them.”

The Police Public Relations Officer of the state Police command, Mr. Victor Babayemi, who confirmed the incident to journalists, said the police had recovered a branded APC vehicle that conveyed the thugs to the venue.

He said the police were on the trail of the fleeing occupants of the vehicle.

Babayemi said, “It was an APC branded vehicle and it is now in our custody. We also recovered four expended cartridges at the scene of the incident. We are happy that some of the perpetrators were known and their names are already with us; that will help our investigation.”

The PPRO added that the leadership of the APC in Ikere Ekiti would be summoned by the police to give the identities of the occupants of the vehicle."

Kubla, the scene of the attacks, borders Borno State, another of the three northeast Nigerian states where the insurgent group remains most active.

Our source said the heavily armed militants arrived in Kubla and started burning houses and stealing foodstuff, until a contingent of the military was mobilized and deployed to confront them.

The soldiers engaged the militants in a fierce exchange of gunfire overnight.

Our source said he was in no position yet to provide details about the level of casualty on the part of the soldiers as well as the militants.

The explosion occurred on Saturday evening after the clash between the policemen and the vandals.

PUNCH Metro had reported on Monday that no fewer than seven people were feared dead in the gun battle between the police and the suspected vandals.

Our correspondent had reported that the vandals attacked the policemen after the cops challenged their illegal activities in the area.

By Tuesday, the security around the site appeared to have been intensified, as rescue officials were equally prevented from accessing it.

A source, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent that the police stopped rescue officials from further incursion into the pipeline site as it had become a security matter.

The source said, “This is a security matter and rescue officials have been asked to stop coming. The police specifically instructed them to stop coming. The fire ought to have gone down by now, so we cannot tell why it’s still burning.”

Meanwhile, one of the relatives of the missing cops told our correspondent that the family had been looking for him, either dead or alive, and the police had not helped their cause.

The relative said, “We have been going round, searching for our brother and we have not been able to see him. The police have been telling us to go into the jungle and search ourselves without any back up or security. What is the meaning of this? They are frustrating us.”

Gun-wielding kidnappers sneaked into a sleepy village around 2 a.m. Friday and seized 90-year-old Ogboro Dark, the mother-in-law of Kombowei Benson, the speaker of the Bayelsa State legislature.

A source told SaharaReporters that the gunmen kidnapped the aged woman from her home in Korokorosei, a riverine town in the Southern Ijaw local government area. The source said the armed men shot in the air, frightening other residents of the community. After abducting Mrs. Dark, her kidnappers reportedly sped off in two or three speedboats.

The kidnap of the speaker’s mother-in-law is the second high-profile abduction in Bayelsa, home state of President Goodluck Jonathan. A few weeks ago, SaharaReporters reported the abduction of five Dutch nationals along the waterways of the state. The Dutch victims were subsequently freed under controversial circumstances that fingered the security aides of Governor Seriake Dickson in a bribery scandal with police authorities.

The Bayelsa State Commissioner of Police, Hilary Opara, confirmed the kidnap of Mrs. Dark, assuring that the police were taking steps to rescue the elderly woman from her kidnappers.

Mr. Opara described the action of the kidnappers as “wicked.”

This incident sent some residents who were heading for their different places of worship to scamper for cover, as the soldiers shot sporadically into the air, as they invaded the area.

They kicked, slapped and according to eye witnesses, they attacked some passengers with machetes, transport officials in the motor park. Even passersby were not spared, as some of them were given the beating of their lives.

One of the transport union officials in the park, Mr. Rotimi Okunowo, who witnessed the incident said it was refusal of a soldier to pay his transport fare that led to the fracas.

The soldier who was said to be in mufti was asked by the bus conductor, Ademola Dosunmu, to produce his identity but he refused.

This, he said, led to an altercation, between the two of them, and they ended up slapping each other.

The soldier was reported to have disembark from the bus, took a stroll down to a corner, tore his clothes, and made a telephone call to his colleagues, who later invaded the park in about three Hilux vans and unleashed mayhem on everyone found within and the precints of the park.

After they left, not less that 20 vehicles were vandalised and valuables like handsets, cash and other valuables were said to have been carted away.

The soldiers were said to belong to the security team protecting pipelines in and around Ijebu Ode axis.

He said, “What happened was that one of the soldiers, who was in a mufti came to the park around 6.30am and when he got to the garage,he claimed he is a staff and will not pay.

” When asked to identified himself,he engaged one of the boys in fracas and within a jiffy,he left the scene,only to return with about 20 men with various dangerous weapons like cutlasses,guns,and broken bottles.

“They beat the boy,Ademola Dosunmu and macheted him and took him away. As that was not enough for them,they vandalised many vehicles parked in the garage and pursued many people into many streets in the town.

“The government should help us to caution these people. You need to see how they beat Ademola blue black and macheted him in many places.

“We are appealing to the government to save us from these soldiers. What we gathered was that they are those assigned to be monitoring the pipelines across the area.

“We cannot bear this again,it is too much for us. They come on daily basis to extort us and yet will come back later in the day to beat our boys up.”

Another eye witness told our correspondent that some vehicles had their tyres deflated."

The clashes which were later brought under control by security operatives took place shortly before Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso presented Sanusi with a letter of appointment and staff of office as the Emir of Kano.

Areas where the pro and anti-Sanusi protesters had a face-off at about 10.30am were the Emir Palace Road and Kofar Nassarawa.

The youth made bornfires on the roads in Kofar Nassarawa and on both sides of the Emir Palace Road before heavily armed policemen arrived and dispersed them.

Some minutes after, they regrouped and attacked one another. Police however reinforced and cordoned off the roads.

The Public Relations Officer of the Police State Command, Magaji Musa-Majia, who said normalcy had been restored to the troubled areas, advised members of the public to go about their business without fear of molestation .

“We have some security challenges at hand but we have deployed counter measures to address the problem,” he said.

Some aggrieved youths had on Sunday staged a protest march from Kofar Nassarawa to the Government House but were halted mid-way by law enforcement agents.

However, the presentation of the appointment letter and staff of office to Sanusi took place amidst tight security at the African House located within the Kano State Government House.

In his address, Kwankwaso explained that the choice of the new emir was purely on merit and devoid of political considerations.

He explained that Sanusi’s wealth of experience and his deep rooted connection with the ruling House, gave him an edge over and above other contenders.

“The new emir was appointed on merit. I must clarify that the six contenders to the throne are good friends and it remains a statement of fact (that) only one would emerge ,” the governor added.

Kwankwaso urged the new Emir to provide an all inclusive cabinet just as he announced that his administration had provided an estate for the family of the late Ado Bayero at Sharada area of the city.

The governor also announced plans to rehabilitate the century old Kano Emir’s palace to make it comfortable for the new occupant.

In his acceptance speech, Sanusi expressed gratitude to Allah for making him the 57th Emir of Kano and the 14th Fulani emir of Kano Emirate.

He said he enjoyed the best support of members of the ruling House, stressing that there was no animosity between him and other princes and princesses.

The ex-CBN governor said, “I was closer to the late Emir than I was to my late father. My first wife of 20 years is Bayero’s daughter. I grew up under his care and shared bed with Turakin Kano, Nasiru Ado Bayero, for 10 years.”

He appealed to his subjects not to allow external forces destroy the harmony they had built over the years.

All the four kingmakers and traditional title holders present during the ceremony pledged allegiance to Sanusi.

However, the absence of members of the immediate family of the late Emir did not go unnoticed.

Those knowledgeable about palace affairs discussed in hushed tones, expressing surprise over the development.

The acting Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, DSP Noble Uwoh, said the incident occurred in a forest located along Igbanke-Ewohimi road during a bid to recover arms and ammunition the suspects secretly kept in the bush in connection with the kidnapping of a female victim and others.

The incident occurred at about 4am and involved four suspects that had allegedly taken the police to the bush, but who were said to have attempted to escape before they were fatally injured in a gun battle.

Two members of the criminal gang allegedly attempted, unsuccessfully, to set their members free.

Uwoh said: “Today, the 15th day of June, 2014, at about 0400 hours, a team of operatives of the anti-kidnapping squad went on an enquiry with four confessed kidnappers, Joy Frank Ogbewe, Jerry Mike Joshua, Lucky Okoruwa and Destiny Ifechukwudi in connection with the case of kidnapping of a female victim and others to a forest along Igbanke-Evwohimi Road to recover their individual arms, which they hid in isolation without allowing themselves knowing each other’s separate armoury.

“On getting to one of the hideouts, no sooner had the operatives disembarked with the suspects, than they came under fire from other members of the criminal gang.

“The policemen engaged the gang in a gun battle and two of the kidnappers were shot. Simultaneously, the other four suspects who took to flight were fatally injured in the cross-exchange of fire.

“The injured suspects during the shootout were rushed to Stella Obasanjo Hospital for treatment, but were certified dead by the medical doctors in the emergency ward. Cordoning and searching of the bush for further recoveries is in progress,” he said.

The police further disclosed that cut-to-size single-barrel guns, 72 live cartridges, two bags of children clothes and women underwear were recovered after the shootout.

Also recovered were a locally-made revolver pistol, four face masks, three padlocks and chain, a cutlass, a Mercedes Benz C-Class car with registration number AGL 133 CX; $8,200; 20, 000 CFA Francs; five UAE’s Dirham and 12 SIM cards that were apparently being switched for negotiating ransom."

The soldier (name withheld), was reportedly stabbed twice with knife in the stomach by the prostitute.

The unnamed prostitute is said to be a Bini lady from from Edo State.



It was learnt that the incident, which occurred about 4.00am on Tuesday, threw the popular ‘Red Light zone’ on Hospital Junction along DSP Alamieyeseigha Way, Yenagoa, into pandemonium.



Most of the customers that slept over with other prostitutes in their shanties, quickly dressed up to avoid being detected by onlookers who thronged the area.



Some sex workers, who spoke with PUNCH Metro claimed that the stabbing forced the intestines of the soldier to come out and he bled profusely.



However, others said the soldiers died later on wednesday at an undisclosed hospital where he was rushed to.

A prostitute, who wished not to be quoted, said the cause of the stabbing was the alleged refusal of the soldier to pay after having bouts of sex with the prostitute.



She said, “When the prostitute asked for her money in the morning, the soldier refused to give her. Then argument ensued between the prostitute and the soldier. The prostitute was angry that after enjoying himself, the soldier refused to pay her. In the ensuing argument, the prostitute grabbed her knife stabbed him (the soldier) in the stomach.”



Another source, who identified himself only as Chika, said the reported death of the soldier caused panic in the area with sex workers running away due to anticipated reprisals by soldiers.



“The incident has created fear among the prostitutes. If you come hear now, the prostitutes have deserted the area.

“We heard argument coming from the prostitute’s room. The next thing we saw was the soldier struggling with blood flowing from the wounds in his stomach.”



When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hilary Opara, confirmed the incident.

Opara said the suspected prostitute had been arrested.



“The suspect has been arrested and the incident is being investigated. However, we have yet to receive report that he died. The soldier is recuperating in the hospital.”



Efforts to reach JTF spokesman, Mustapha Anka, a lieutenant colonel, for comments, were not successful.

He simply said he was in a meeting."

Ebea said that himself; the Edo Assembly Minority Leader, Emmanuel Okoduwa; and Patrick Iluobe, were on their way to Benin City, the Edo State capital, from Esan in the Edo Central Senatorial District, when the assailants accosted them around 1pm.

The PUNCH learnt that the lawmakers were returning from Ebele, Igueben Local Government Area of the state, where they had attended an investiture of the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Anthony Anenih, by the Anglican Church.

The three were said to be inside an SUV belonging to one of the lawmakers and were returning to Benin in a convoy consisting of some other vehicles when the assailants stopped their vehicles at Abudu and opened fire on them.

Ebea said one of the gunmen was however killed during an exchange of fire that followed between the assailants and the security operatives attached to the deputy speaker. One of the drivers in the convoy of the lawmakers was also said to have been shot and was receiving medical attention at an undisclosed hospital.

The Edo State chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih, said the lawmakers’ vehicles were just ahead of his own when the incident happened and that it was obvious that the lawmakers were the primary targets of the attack.

Orbih said, “They (the lawmakers) were confronted with a hail of bullets. The event they attended was well publicised and it is obvious that the attack was aimed at them.

“We call on the police to investigate and find out the people behind the attack.

“However, we thank God for saving their lives from blood-thirsty political assassins.”

The PDP chairman, who said that a report had been made at the Abudu police station, said he was worried that the attack on the lawmakers occurred not quite long after some of the members of the Edo State House of Assembly had defected the PDP

When contacted on Sunday night, the Police Public Relations Officer, Edo State Command, Noble Umoh, said that he had not been briefed about the matter and that he was still trying to reach the Divisional Police Officer at the Abudu police station.

There has been a lingering crisis in the Edo State House of Assembly since the suspension of the deputy speaker and three PDP lawmakers on June 9.

Four other persons were killed by yet-to-be-identified gunmen in separate incidents in another two villages. Among the four were a man and his wife said to have been killed in Rikarwan village in the Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of the state.

Also, another man, Dauda Maidawa; and his wife, Alheri who were said to have travelled to their farm located at Fadan- Karshi in the Sanga Local Government Area of the state in the early hours of Saturday were found dead.

However, when contacted, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, Aminu Lawan, a Superintendent of Police, said he was yet to receive details of the incidents.

“I am not aware but give me some time to contact relevant persons and find out from them,” he told our correspondent.

At Fadan-Chawai, it was learnt that the youths had gone on rampage, destroying property worth millions of naira over the announcement of the new chief in the area.

The National President of Chawai Development Association, Chief Augustine Audi, said the governor’s order for the Chawai Council of Kingmakers to nominate and send to him the name of the son of the late Res Tsam for appointment caused the crisis.

He said, “As a result of the appointment and announcement of the new Res Tsam by Kaduna State Governor Mukhtar Yero, violence erupted in the chiefdom, leading to the killing of two people and property destroyed by rampaging youths in the area.

“We do not see the need for the urgency in appointing the next Res Tsam when the customs and tradition of the Chawai people do not support that.

“There are traditional rites that were to be performed before the appointment, which is why unlike the Hausa or Emirate system, it takes time before a new Res Tsam is appointed.”

Meanwhile, an eyewitness said the killing of the Rikarwan couple, Ayuba Kure and Sarah occurred on Sunday night.

“The gunmen came on Sunday night with dangerous weapons, killed the couple and injured four others. You know our communities are isolated and no one knows the mission of the gunmen,” said the eyewitness, who asked not to be named.

A brother of the victim, John Joseph, said the matter was reported to the Divisional Police Officer at Fadan-Karshi Police Station who then mobilised for a search that led to the discovery of the remains of his brother and the wife.

But when contacted, the spokesman for Yero, Mallam Ahmed Maiyaki, said, “Nobody was killed and everything is peaceful and calm in the areas mentioned.”

The clash between AY and Vagas cult groups was said to have claimed the lives of the students – a 300 level engineering student and two final year students.

The alleged killings were said to have taken place before and during the school’s semester examinations which ended last week.

It was gathered that the unnamed 300 level student was inflicted with machete cuts by the cultists and later died in a private hospital at Amassoma in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state where he was taken to.

A student, who gave his name simply as Dan, alleged that a final year male student was also killed by a group of cultists who stormed the examination hall.

“The finalist was in the hall writing exams when the cultists – about eight in number, stormed the hall and shot him dead. They escaped after shooting sporadically into the air to scare other students,” Dan, who lives on the campus, said.

Efforts to get the school authorities to respond to the sad development did not yield results.

Calls to the institution’s spokesman, Mr. Domo Alagoa, were not answered.

The text message sent to Alagoa’s phone was also not responded to as of press time.

Police authorities however said they did not have record of any killing in the university.

Commissioner of Police, Bayelsa State Police Command, Mr. Hilary Opara, though confirmed cult activities on the campus, he said he never heard of anyone killed.

He said the only sad incident was that a student was inflicted with machete cuts but did not die.

Opara said, “It is not true, not even one person died. There was some cult activity and during the process one of them was inflicted with machete cuts. The victim did not die.

“We are investigating the matter. As I speak to you, five cultists have been arrested. Others are still on the run.”"

The youths were protesting the death of about 10 people who drowned on Saturday evening after a makeshift bridge across a river collapsed as a result of heavy rain.

Our correspondent who visited the two communities early on Sunday observed that caterpillars, office equipment and other property belonging to the company were destroyed by the angry youths, who broke into the work station and offices within.

Thousands of residents were also seen at the Apete end of the river bank waiting for rescue operation to commence while some of them were throwing stones and other objects at a combined team of security forces who stood ground at the Ijokodo end of the road to maintain order.

One of the securitymen employed by the construction company, Bassey Etum, said he had to run for dear life alongside five other colleagues when the irate youths stormed the place on Saturday night.

He said, “After the river had overflown its banks, residents at the community said people drowned because of the bridge that collapsed. So the angry youths came and destroyed our machines and equipment.

“They stole computers and other office equipment too. There were six securitymen here when they came last night. They wanted to lynch us so we ran into a nearby forest. When we returned around 11pm, nothing was left untouched; the whole place had been vandalised.”

An eyewitness, Tunde Emiola, said the youths were angered by the slow pace of the construction company and increasing number of deaths resulting from the dilapidated state of the bridge.

He said, “The rain started in the afternoon but by 6.30pm the bridge was submerged and standing precariously. I was among the crowd at the Apete end of the river bank.

“We saw people trying to make use of the bridge and warned them but they were desperate to reach home before it was too dark.

“Suddenly, the wooden pillars holding the bridge collapsed and people fell into the river. The current was too much so there was little hope for survival.

“We rescued two people but more that 10 others drowned immediately. I was there and saw it all till very late. The youths were really angry at the number of those that died.”

Emiola said the river was formed by many other rivers included Ogun river, Eleyele river and so on, and that the collapsed bridge was the only link between Ijokodo community and Apete, Ajibode, Arula, Awotan, Olomo and other communities in the area, adding that the original bridge was swept away by a downpour four years ago.

One of the policemen at the scene of the disaster said the youths were hostile towards them, wondering why they had to take laws into their own hands.

He said, “They threw stones at us and shouted at us from the other side of the river when we reached here. They said the government abandoned them and caused the death of their neighbours who were swept away on Saturday evening.”

Chairman of Ido Local Government, Prof. Joseph Olowofela, said the development was unfortunate, adding that just a day before the disaster, the council executives had decided to construct a stronger pedestrian bridge in place of the one that collapsed on Saturday.

He said, “I was here on Friday with the contractor that was to erect the bridge. But we realised that the volume of the water was too much so we decided to wait for it to come down.

” Those who were rescued have been taken to a hospital.

“We have a large number of people here so we will go ahead and construct the bridge. Whatever we do is a palliative measure becaue the state government through a contractor is already working on a standard bridge that will be completed before the end of this year.”"

Although residents told our correspondent that nobody was killed in the raid, the robbers injured scores with some said to be receiving treatment in hospitals.

A security guard in one of the affected houses, Mr. Kingsley Udofia, said he was sitting inside the gate house when he heard someone jump into the compound.

He said the robbers forced the gate open by breaking the padlocks and asked him to surrender any weapon that was in his possession.

He said, “The robbers who were almost 30 in number asked me to lie face down. They told me that if I should shout, move or try to do anything funny, they would kill me at once.

“The robbers came into the estate with all sorts of implements like daggers, hammers and many others. They broke my boss’s Honda SUV glasses as they thought money was in the vehicle.

“The robbers, however, made away with plasma TVs, DSTV cables, mobile phones, stereo players and the little cash they could get. I lost my two mobile phones in the incident.”

A victim, Mrs. Affiong Etim, said the robbers entered her house and stole valuables like gold jewelleries, wristwatches, mobile phones, LCD television and cash.

She stated that the robbers threatened to shoot at anyone who refused to cooperate with them.

Etim said the night was terrible as she had not seen a thing like that before. She said they called the police around 1am, but the police told them that they were aware of the incident and that they would come in a short while to rescue the situation.

She said, “We waited for the police in vain. The robbers came and operated for almost two and a half hours unchallenged. The police came about 20 minutes after the robbers had left.

“The robbers we saw that night were professionals. They came with different tools. They even went as far as removing roofs to gain entry into people’s houses.

“None of them passed through the main doors. The sound of guns was terrifying.”

All efforts to get response from the Police Public Relations Officer, Akwa Ibom State Police Command, Mr. Etim Dickson, proved abortive. He did not answer his calls nor respond to text messages sent to him."

Eyewitnesses said the students were demanding for the release of one of them who was arrested by the police.

Trouble began when some students of the institution mounted a road block around their Bora Hostel, begging for money from motorists in preparation for Bora Week celebration. The hostel is located some kilometres away from the school.

One of the students, who refused to be named, said the police approached the group on the road to put a stop to the act, which led to the arrest of one of them.

“I am a member of the school’s Man O War and we were having our morning training when some students ran into the school from Bora hostel. They said the police arrested Boluwatife, alias Active. He is aspiring for a students’ union position in the school. They said some students ran away when they saw the police but Bolu did not run away, leading to his arrest and detention,” he said.

The student added that around 9:30am, several students were mobilised. They all went to the Apata police station to secure the release of Boluwatife but they were told to come back at 10am.

“We told them that it was almost 10am and that we preferred to wait but they forcefully sent us out of the station. This led to the students’ fury. They mounted a road block on the major road while seven canisters of tear gas were fired by the police. Bolu was later released,” he added.

Attempt by our correspondent to reach the state Police Public Relation Officer, Olabisi Ilobanefor, on the telephone failed while her second in command, Basiru Adewale, said he was on his annual leave and could not offer any information on the issue.

A suspected crossborder raid overnight by Nigeria’s radical Islamic group Boko Haram killed two Cameroonian soldiers, a Cameroonian security official said Friday on condition of anonymity.

The attack occurred late Thursday in the border village of Balgaram in northern Cameroon. Eight soldiers posted there fought back, and “in the clash we lost two men,” the official said.

Military reinforcements were sent to the area and several troops “entered Nigerian territory with the aim of finding the assailants,” the official said.

The armed Boko Haram movement is seeking to install an extremist Islamic state in Nigeria. It started its bloody insurgency in 2009.

In recent days, the group has been blamed for several clashes, abductions and killings targeting troops in northern Cameroon deployed to counter them.

More than 3,000 Nigerians fleeing Boko Haram attacks have taken refuge in the Cameroonian town of Fotokol, a municipal official said.

“We are worried about infiltrations” by the Islamists among the refugees, a police officer in the town said.

The lady was kidnapped on Sunday, alongside a traditional ruler of Kolofata town in Cameroon.

The rescue operation was carried out by soldiers from Cameroon in an operation that was reported to have lasted several hours.

According to Hausa Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation, 16 people died during the rescue operation.

Cameroon’s Minister of Information, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, confirmed the freedom of the vice prime minister’s wife.

Bakary said government was still investigating the number of casualties.

Meanwhile, some members of the deadly Boko Haram sect on Monday attacked Katarko village, in the outskirts of Damaturu, the Yobe State capital, killing eight persons and blowing off an important bridge.

Katarko is 22 kilometers south of Damaturu, Yobe State capital, and a community in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, which is believed to be one of the strongest hold of the sect in the north-eastern state.

Residents told journalists on the telephone that the insurgents stormed the town around 7.30 pm, and attacked the military base before moving to some houses, where eight persons were killed.

One of the residents who claimed that the siege was on for over seven hours, told journalists on Tuesday that, “They came here and launched an unsuccessful attack on the military base before embarking on some selective killings within the town living us with eight casualties presently being prepared for burial.”

He said the insurgents stormed the town around 7.30 pm and carried out their attack until 2.30 am without any form of resistance.

It was also gathered that during the siege the insurgents blew off the Katarko Bridge linking Damaturu to their stronghold; Buni Yadi, the headquarters of Gujba Local Government Area of the state. This area connects Yobe and neighbouring Borno and Adamawa states, all under emergency rule as a result of the Boko Haram insurgency.

This is the first time Boko Haram militants are attacking Katarko, since the commencement of their hostility in 2009.

In a similar report, two suspected members of the sect had been arrested in Damaturu metropolis for being in possession of Improvise Explosive Devices.They are believed to have the intention of causing havoc in the troubled town.

Although authorities declined comment on the arrest, residents confirmed that the suspects were arrested at separate locations within the metropolis with the devices.

They claimed that the first arrested insurgent gave out information on the second hoodlum, who was later picked up at another part of the troubled town.

The 90-year-old Florentina was abducted on Wednesday morning at her residence in Opolo-Epie, Yenagoa area of the state.

Neighbours of the nonagenarian were angry that the kidnappers forcibly took the woman away despite her age.

Their anger also came against the backdrop that Florentina was being kidnapped for the second time in four years.

It was learnt that the abductors called about 3am on Wednesday when the victim and other residents were sleeping to execute their sinister plot.

A security source said the kidnappers were five in number and were fully armed with AK47 and other rifles.

The source, who did not want his name mentioned, said, “They came through the main road. They drove a vehicle into the community and immediately started shooting sporadically into the air to create apprehension among neighbours who were already asleep.

“They forced the door open, seized the old woman and whisked her away to an unknown place. Some residents thought the kidnappers were armed robbers.

“Some of the residents later came out and started shouting ‘thieves, thieves’ only to discover later that the woman had been abducted.”

When contacted the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hilary Opara, confirmed the development and said one of the suspected kidnappers had been arrested.

He said the suspect was helping the police in their investigations.

The commissioner said, “Although the report got to the police after the kidnappers had gone, we immediately swung into action and arrested one suspect who is already assisting the police in investigation and we beleive that in no distant time, the victim would be recued.”

He urged members of the public to go about their normal businesses, vowing that the police would continue to protect their lives and property.

Opara said the state special security outfit, Operation Doo Akpo, and other anti-crime outfits were on top of the situation.

He also lauded the state government for providing logistics to the command and commended members of the public for their cooperation.”"

It was also gathered that the gunmen after destroying the churches told some members of the communities that their next target would be the Local Government Secretariat Headquarters in Hawul.

Although no life was lost, the gunmen operated freely without confrontation from either residents or security operatives.

The Caretaker Chairman of Hawul Local Government Area, Dr. Andrew Usman Malgwi, confirmed the burning of churches in some of his communities with the threats that “the Council secretariat will be the next target of the terrorists.”

He explained that the insurgents have now shifted their deadly attacks and destruction to Hawul, and therefore called on the government and security agencies to immediately deploy troops to safeguard lives and property of innocent citizenry."

There was confusion on Sunday morning after two military officers, identified as Hilary and Sheu Abdullahi, died after a brutal clash.

Our correspondent gathered that the incident happened at a popular night club on Pen Crescent, Apapa area of Lagos.

The PUNCH learnt from a reliable source that Hilary, a corporal in the Nigerian Army, had gone to the club with his girlfriend who was donned in a military outfit.

The source said, “The bouncers at the club stopped the lady and challenged her, asking if she was a soldier. But Hilary asked why they would question his girlfriend in his presence.

“Abdullahi, a naval officer, who was equally at the club with his girlfriend, came out to intervene. After listening to the bouncers, he told Hilary it was wrong for his girlfriend to wear a military uniform when she was not one. That was how Hilary left the bouncers and decided to tackle Abdullahi.”

Another source told our correspondent that the fight began after Abdullahi slapped the soldier’s girlfriend for disrespecting him.

He said, “The soldier was angry and went after the naval officer. He stabbed him with a jackknife and he died on the spot.”

Our correspondent gathered that Abdullahi’s colleagues, after getting wind of the situation, mobilised to the scene.

It was learnt that in retaliation, the men pounced on Hilary, and beat him to a pulp.

The affray was said to have escalated after the soldier gave up in their hands.

A resident was said to have made a distress call to policemen at the Apapa Police Division who arrived the scene on time to prevent further bloodshed.

The Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Lelma Kolle, while confirming the incident, said the police made two arrests at the scene.

He said, “Yes, the incident happened. Actually, two people died. We received a distress call from someone that there was a situation at the club and we instantly rushed to the scene. We were able to bring the situation under control and prevent further loss of lives. It was just unfortunate that by the time we got there, the two officers had died. But the police arrested two military officers in connection with the incident.”

He added that the case had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba, and the corpses of the slain officers, deposited in the mortuary.

The Army Public Relations Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Omale Ochagwuba, said he was at a programme and would appreciate if our correspondent could visit his office.

The Command Information Officer of the Western Naval Command, Lieutenant Commander Way Olabisi, said he would get back to our correspondent on the incident.

Two other persons were also injured by the rampaging gunmen who stormed a bar located along Aggrey Road and opened fire on those sitting outside the bar.

The incident, which occurred at about 10pm on Monday, caused pandemonium around the busy area popularly known as ‘Town,’ even as passersby and motorists took shortcuts to avoid the scene of the incident.

Though, the motive of the gunmen, who were suspected to be cult members was not known, one of the residents of the area expressed fear that the dark days of violent crime might be back to the state.

“The way these people (unknown gunmen) operate now is making everybody to be afraid. They drove in and started shooting and at the end, we heard that two person were killed while another two were seriously injured.

“From what happened that night, it is like the dark days of cult clash are here again,” a resident of Aggrey Road in Port Harcourt told The PUNCH.

It was learnt that the attack on the bar took place few hours after a cleric was killed during a clash between two communities in Gokana Local Government Area.

It was gathered that one of the two persons killed at the bar died in a nearby hospital as a result of the gunshot injuries sustained during the incident.

A source said the attack on the bar was not unconnected with the rivalry between Icelanders and Greenlanders cult groups.

However, the State Assistant Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Grace Iringe-Koko, did not confirm the attack on the bar along Aggrey Road, adding that she has not been briefed on the incident."

Investigations by The PUNCH in Lafia on Tuesday revealed that the motorcyclists were stopped by the suspected ritualists , who pretended to be labourers .

It was gathered that the suspects asked the riders to take them to somewhere along Keffi /Nasarawa Road.

Some of the residents of the area, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent that they saw some people standing along the road holding shovels, cutlasses and measuring tapes.

They said that they later heard gunshots but could not go near the scene because they were unarmed.

One of them said the suspected ritualists killed and dumped the bodies of the motorcyclists in the uncompleted building for more than seven days.

The residents and passers-by, who perceived a strange odour, were said to have raised the alarm.

Policemen, who came to the scene, took the corpses away and deposited them at the Federal Medical Centre, Keffi.

Another resident said, “We perceived an odour and decided to move close to where it emanated from .

“When we got there, we couldn’t believe what we saw. We quickly raised the alarm. This was how the police and members of the public got to know that some Okada riders had been murdered and their corpses left there.”

An Okada rider, Emmanuel John, told our correspondent that when he heard two gunshots, he fled.

John said, ‘I managed to escape from the area even when one of the suspects sighted me. I quickly reported the matter to a police station in Keffi; but I did know what actually happened since then until when I heard that the police found four decomposing bodies of Okada riders.”

The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Ismaila Numan, said the command received a call at about 11pm on August 10, 2014 that corpses of four motorcyclists were found in an uncompleted building.

Bayo Salami, alleged on Saturday that gunmen invaded his house located at the Government Reservation Area, Osogbo, Osun State with the aim of killing him.

He said he and his family narrowly escaped death when the gunmen, invaded his house at about10:05 pm on Friday.

The house of the former federal lawmaker is less than five minutes walk from the headquarters of the state police command.

He once represented Osun Central under the defunct Alliance for Democracy between 1999-2003 in the Senate.

Salami told journalists at his Olu-Ode polling unit that the gunmen, numbering about 15 and including a lady, came in a bus and a Sport Utility Vehicle.

The intent of the gunmen, he said, was to kidnap him and keep him away from the Olu-Ode area where he had massive followership.

Salami said the gunmen forcefully gained entrance into his compound after overpowering the security man at the gate attempted to gain entry firing at the door.

He said “At about10:05 pm on Friday, about 15 men stormed my house with masked gunmen in a bus and SUV. They beat up my security man at the gate and carried him away. They did all that, so me and my family moved into one room.

“They shouted ‘open the door or we will shoot it down.’ They shot at the door thinking it was a wooden door. They shot at the door several times but they could not gain entry.

“When you go to my house now you will see the pellets littered around.”

He said upon their failure to gain access to him and his family, they turned on themselves, blaming one another for the failure of their mission.

“They fought themselves before leaving my compound. They were saying to themselves I told you we should have come here earlier, “he narrated.

On whey he did not report the matter to the police, he said “I don’t have cause to go to police. I sent text to people who could help me out.”

He said, “This is desperation, not democracy. They did it to me, I saw it live. With what they did yesterday (Friday) night I now know they don’t have decorum.

“I now know I am open for attack. If you get to my house you will see all the evidence.”

On the election he said, “Today’s election, PDP is not winning. APC has won election in this state and we want to see how they (PDP) will win.”

It was gathered that trouble started when the deposed paramount ruler of Oboi/Akpor Urebisi, Chief Anthony Uwabie, shot at a group of men at Wimpey Junction.



The bullet, according to an eyewitness, hit his son, Clement Uwabie, a strong member of the PDP.



Uwabie’s son explained to newsmen in the hospital where he and other injured persons were receiving treatment that his father shot him because he refused to join the APC.



Some youths were said to have converged on Rumueprikom on Wednesday in anticipation of the visit of the State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, who had been on local government tour.



Eyewitnesses said the youths were beating drums when they heard the sound of gunshots.



Angered by the development, the youths made moves to storm Chief Uwabie’s residence, but were stopped by the police.



Confirming the incident, the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Tunde Ogunsakin, who confirmed the incident, said Uwabie shot his son and six people.

Ogunsakin added that the matter had been transferred to the State Anti-Robbery Squad for further investigation.

World Bulletin / News Desk | A number of Cameroonian troops have gone missing after Boko Haram militants attacked the northern town of Bonderi on the border with Nigeria, a Cameroonian security official said Thursday.

“We are certain that the assailants are Boko Haram militants,” the official told Anadolu Agency. “We are saddened to have lost some of our men.”

The official added that a number of Cameroonian military vehicles had been seized during clashes with the militants, which erupted in the early hours of Thursday.

He went on to say that reports on the incident – and the casualties that accompanied it – had yet to be finalized.

This is the second attack this month on the border town by suspected Boko Haram militants.

On August 6, the town’s police station came under rocket attack.

Cameroonian officials said six Boko Haram militants had been killed in subsequent clashes, while several Cameroonian police vehicles had been seized by militants.

Boko Haram turned violent in 2009 following the extrajudicial murder of leader Mohamed Yusuf while in police custody.

The group has since been blamed for the destruction of public infrastructure and private businesses, along with the displacement of at least six million people in northern Nigeria.

The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Celestina Kalu said the suspects were felled by a stop-and-search squad after they received a distressed call from the victims.

She said, “Two men riding on Lifan motorcycle with registration number AGB 278 QN opened fire on the policemen and in the ensuing exchange of fire, one of the suspects was shot and arrested while the other one escaped.

“The injured suspect however gave up the ghost on the way to hospital. Later on, the Dragon team in conjunction with Abavo vigilante men combed the bush and arrested the fleeing suspect, one Sunday Ngozi of Agbor-Obi.”

The suspects were fleeing from the town after robbing a petrol attendant of undisclosed amount of money at a filling station (name withheld) when they ran into operatives of Dragon Patrol Team 05 of the Delta State Police Command.

The operatives were said to have received a distressed call that armed robbers operating in a Lifan motorcycle had robbed within the town and were heading towards Urhonigbe in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Delta State.

Narrating her ordeal, the petrol attendant, one Isioma Lawrence said the hoodlums came into the filling station on the pretext that they wanted to refill their tank.

The Islamist terrorist group, Boko Haram, has continued its offensive in Cameroon, as it killed at least three people and kidnapped 15 others in a fresh cross-border attack in northern Cameroun.



According to a security source, the attack took place on Monday.

“The attack took place on Monday afternoon when at least 20 armed men tried to get food supplies, stealing all the food stocks found in the Camerounian village of Greya,” the source told Anadolu Agency yesterday.

The source added, “Boko Haram militants killed at least three civilians and abducted a dozen others – presumably all Camerounians. “Before leaving, the terrorists also burned down the village’s primary school.”

Due to the area’s poor communication infrastructure, the Camerounian army was warned too late of the incident, finally arriving “long after the attackers had left,” the source stated.

According to the AFP, the militant group has already been blamed for several previous cross-border attacks from Nigeria.

In a related development, the news agency reported that at least 11 Camerounian boys kidnapped in July by the Islamist militants had escaped.

The boys, aged between seven and 15 years old, had been kidnapped by the militant group during a cross-border attack on Cameroun’s northern town.

“The boys say they were detained near Madagali, a town in Adamawa State, Nigeria. After taking them from Cameroun, Boko Haram had enrolled them at a Quranic school,” the source told Anadolu on condition of anonymity. “Days later, the school was attacked by unknown persons and they took advantage of the confusion to escape,” he added.

On their way back home, the boys reached Vizik, a Nigerian town on the border with Cameroon, from where they managed to secure a lift across the border, according to the same source. The 11 boys have since been handed over to the Camerounian security services, which are still holding them for questioning.

“The story of their escape is not consistent; their journey from Nigeria to Cameroun is not clear,” the source said.

He went on to voice fears that they had not actually escaped but rather had been “enlisted” by Boko Haram to carry out attacks in Cameroun.

“They have provided no clear location of their place of detention in Nigeria. They gave no clue to the fate of others abducted in the same attack, including the wife of Deputy Prime Minister Amadou Ali or even Kolofata Mayor Seiny Boukar Lamine,” he added.

The late ruler’s wife, Mrs. Sarah Okon-Effiong, told The PUNCH on Tuesday that her husband left the village last Thursday to Calabar, only to be killed that same day in his house at the Bayside area of Calabar-South by men suspected to be hired assassins.

She said, “I was in the village that day, but at about 11.30pm, my son called to inform me that my husband had been killed. The killers, who were about six, came with his photograph and traced him to his bedroom where they tied him to a cushion chair, shot at him and axed his head afterwards.

“Before they killed him, they put a call through to someone, who probably sent them, to confirm whether my husband was actually the one they came for. The person answered in the affirmative after which they murdered him.”

Sarah said some family members had accused the deceased, along with some elders, of being responsible for the death of one of their relatives, Benjamin Etim, through witchcraft.

She alleged that the family members might have organised her husband’s assasination.

The second son of the deceased, Odionka Okon-Effiong, said the dismembered body of his father was deposited at the mortuary of the General Hospital, Calabar, by the police team from Atakpa division which arrived at the scene after the killers had escaped.

It was learnt that the remains of the traditional ruler had been buried in line with traditions.

Spokesperson of the Cross River State Police Command, Mr. Hogan Bassey, confirmed the incident.

He added that the matter was under investigations.

The PUNCH learnt on Monday that the clash ensued when Eggon youths attacked Alingani as a revenge for the destruction of Eggon farms by the Fulani herdsmen and their cattle.

Investigations by our reporter showed that the youths initially on Saturday evening, launched an attack on worshipers in a mosque, killing about three people and injuring many others.

The PUNCH also gathered that the attackers also burnt down houses belonging to the fleeing Fulani cattle breeders.

Our correspondent, who went round the state capital, sighted more than 100 Eggon refugees comprising women and children who fled their ancestral homes.

The refugees, who fled their homes for fear of being attacked by the Fulani, were brought to the state capital in a truck. They assembled in front of frontage of Dalhatu Specialist Hospital.

In an interview with our correspondent, two Eggon indigenes, Musa Idris and Aisha Sule, said “We cannot continue to stay in that community again because the Fulani have already taken over the entire community and there is no security man there to protect us.

“As we are talking to you now, our houses have been burnt by the attackers and our farms have been destroyed by the Fulani.

“The policemen that came to the area to rescue us were overpowered by the Fulani herdsmen in the area.”

An eye witness told our correspondent that the people that were killed were more than 25. He added that their corpses were dumped in a bush.

He said the fight between the Fulani herdsmen and Eggon youths broke out when the herdsmen encroached on farmlands belonging to the Eggon.

When contacted on the telephone, the state’s Secretary of Mayetta Allah Cattle Breeders Association, Altai Hussein Abubakar, told our correspondent that four Fulani people were killed by Ombatse militia.

Abubakar, however, stressed that the Eggon were peace-loving people who had lived with the Fulani in the area for over 150 years.

He said current Ombatse onslaught on several communities in the state could not be said to be an ethnic clash with the Eggon ethnic nationality.

He said, “Our leaders from both Eggon and Fulani communities in the state must not allow youths, most of whom are drug addicts and mentally deranged to set such a violent social agenda for us, and so we are calling on our leaders, the government and security agencies to halt this lingering violent aggression.”

But the Police Public Relations Officer, Ismaila Numan, Nasarawa State Command, who confirmed the incident, said the Police only rescued three persons who were injured and took them to Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia.

He added that the police recovered two corpses."

Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that both lawmakers, who are eyeing the party’s ticket to contest for a seat in the House of Representatives in the 2015 general elections, clashed during a programme organised by Adigun-Hammed to foster relationship between spare parts traders and the state governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi.

He said, “The traders are not happy that the governor neglected them. Adigun-Hammed then organised a programme to link the two parties.

“On Wednesday, Olatoye came to the venue with many of his supporters before Adigun-Hammed and Ajimobi arrived. Members of the governor’s advance party were already there. Popular Ibadan Fuji musician, Rashidi Ayinde, was on the podium singing the praise of Olatoye. When Adigun-Hammed arrived around 3pm, he wanted to cancel the programme but he was told that it was too close as the governor would be on his way soon. So the programme continued.”

The eyewitness said further that supporters of Adigun-Hammed, who organised the programme, were not happy with the praises that Olatoye was getting from the musician, leading to a clash before Ajimobi arrived at the venue.

He said, “Cars and other valuable property were destroyed at the scene, with supporters attacking themselves with weapons while the traders ran for their safety.”

Olatoye was later seen around the state governor’s office building with blood-soaked clothe. The musician was also seen around the area with his clothe also soaked in blood. He was appealing to supporters of both lawmakers to embrace peace.

Expelled Yaba College of Tech Cult members Our student sources said the deaths occurred as rival cult gangs on the campus clashed over claims of seniority. On Wednesday, August 27, one student of the College identified as Peter Adetunji was reportedly shot dead by members of the Buccaneers cult, also called Alora. Eyewitnesses said the victim was shot on the head in front of the Student Union Building on the campus. Mr. Adetunji died of severe bleeding arising from the gunshot wound.

Our sources said that another student, who was identified by his alias of Burna Boy, was last Thursday in front of a First Bank Branch at Fadeyi bus stop near the WAEC headquarters. The location of the second killing is in the neighborhood of the college, which is Nigeria’s first major institution of higher learning.

Several students who spoke to SaharaReporters said they suspected that the latest victim, Burna Boy, was killed as a revenge attack for Mr. Adetunji’s murder on Wednesday.

Our sources said Peter Adetunji belonged to the Eiye Confraternity while Burna Boy was a member of the Buccaneers.

A part-time student at Yaba Tech said he and other students had avoided going to the school since the shooting attacks began in the middle of the week. “We are supposed to commence our examination this weekend, but some of us are afraid that another violent clash may occur,” said the source. He added: “Right now, our prayer is that the authorities at the school shift the examination [schedule] to a time when peace has returned.”

Yaba Tech has been dogged by violent cult clashes over its history. Some students alleged that numerous college officials at Yaba College of Technology are top members, sponsors and financiers of some cult groups. They also accused school officials of victimizing, even sacking, students who dare to protest or speak against the excesses of the cult gangs.

“What the gangs are doing now is score counting. They are now on one-to-one count,” said a student. “We do not know at what score of deaths they will stop at,” he added.

Several students said they had no hope of the cult violence abating unless the Federal Government steps in to fire school administrators and lecturers who are patrons of various cult gangs."

Madagali town is the headquarters of the Madagali Local Government Area and it shares border with Borno State. It is also the closest town to Gwoza, the town that Boko Haram has already annexed.

The church, in an electronic press statement by the Director, Catholic Social Communications in-charge of the Maiduguri Diocese, Rev. Fr. Gideon Obasogie, said that though the members of Boko Haram had been known not to discriminate in their attacks, it however seemed that Christians and Christian institutions had been at the receiving end of the sect’s mayhem.

Obasogie said, “The whole town and the parish rectory have been occupied by the terrorists; so many structures and items have been vandalised. Dozens killed and a lot of church structures have been burnt down.”

“Christians in the town are really in a terribly situation; a moment of great persecution.

“Christian men are caught and beheaded; the women are forced to become Muslims and are taken as wives to the terrorists. The houses of Christians that have fled are now occupied by the insurgents.

“Their cars are used by the terrorists. Some Muslims around identify Christian homes to be occupied and the Christians in hiding were also identified and killed. Strict Sharia Law has been promulgated, as observed by a woman who luckily escaped the death zone.”

The priest said the situation had gone out of control. “People are finding it really hard, citizens are been killed in their numbers,” he added.

He said the Catholic Church had been compelled to close down all the churches on the major road linking Borno and Adamawa states because of acts of terrorism.

Hawul, is south and about 220 kilometres drive from Maiduguri, the state capital, which is under serious attacks by insurgents following nondeployment of military troops despite outcries by residents of the area.

A resident of the area, who does not want his name in print, told our correspondent on phone that the gunmen stormed the villages on Thursday night, killing seven people before moving to the other surrounding villages and slaughtered seven people in an operation which lasted till 5am on Friday.

He said the gunmen, who arrived Jibwhiwhui at about 10pm, started entering houses, arresting their occupants and shooting them to death instantly.

An indigene of the area resident in Maiduguri told our correspondent that he was told that the gunmen who came on motorcycles stormed the village and killed seven people before moving to the nearby villages and killed another seven people.

He said the insurgents killed three sons of his uncle, but owing to the security lapses on the major road, he could not travel home, adding that his cousin who lost his uncle had already travelled home through the hectic Damaturu -Potiskum -Gombe- Biu road to attend the three-day prayer for the deceased.

It would be recalled that on Wednesday, gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram terrorists attacked Miringa town of Biu Local Government area and burnt down GSM telecom masts in the town but did not kill anybody after snatching a Toyota Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to an APC chieftain, name withheld.

Efforts to get the Police Public Relation Officer, Gidoen Jibrin, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, for confirmation proved abortive, as his phones were switched off at the time of filing in this report, even as a senior government official from the area who did not want his name mentioned in print for security reasons, confirmed the killings of residents by insurgents on Thursday."

The market was recently gutted by fire.

Apart from the State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, who promised to help the traders financially, other notable people in the state visited the traders and promised to help them. One of them was PDP governorship aspirant, Seyi Makinde, who said he would drill a borehole for the market to forestall future occurrence.



Makinde made good his promise by starting the project, but on Sunday, workers at the site of the project were allegedly attacked by some people, who also blocked the 70-foot borehole with stones and pebbles.

The attackers were alleged to have been sponsored by the Chairman of the South-West council area of the state, Mr. Taoheed Adeleke, under whose council the market falls. Eyewitnesses said hoodlums came in large numbers with cutlasses and other weapons.

The chairman, however, denied being involved in the attack, when he spoke with our correspondent on Monday.



Traders who spoke with our correspondent expressed dissatisfaction over the development.

Chairman of Fancy Section of the market, Mr. Rahman Olabamiji, said, “Yesterday (Sunday), Makinde brought an engine and started work on the borehole without demanding money from us. They were about to finish the borehole when some people stormed the market with weapons and blocked the borehole.”



In his response, Adeleke said, “The council was given an order by the governor to drill a borehole for the market and we chose a site. On Sunday, we went there to clear the debris, but found out that someone had instructed an engineer to drill another borehole at the market. When we could not identify the initiator, we invited the police who sent them away. We later got the news that Makinde was the initiator and I wondered why he did not inform us that he was doing such a project in the market. Nobody was attacked and no one went there with weapons. It was all lies.”"

Youths in Gambouru, Borno State, are said to be resisting conscription by the Boko Haram Islamic sect as the terrorists look for more men to boost their ranks.

It was learnt that at least 29 people have been killed in Gambouru for refusing conscription.

The town has been under Boko Haram control for about a week.

A group of terrorists had earlier invaded Jibwhuwhi and Dalwa villages in Hawul local government area of the state killing 14 residents before setting ablaze their houses, shops and churches.

The insurgents, according to a resident, who did not want his name mentioned, had been conscripting young men.

He said those that refused to join the sect were shot dead or had their throats slit before family members.

He said: “Our people have no option other than to submit to God’s destiny and mercies on Gambouru town and its residents that could not flee.

“Since last Monday’s attacks, we had been hiding in ceilings of buildings and underground water reservoirs without food and water.

“But the insurgents are adamant and ruthless in pursuing us to either be conscripted or killed for not joining the sect fight our soldiers here in Gambouru.

“These boys have been going from house to house in search of hiding residents. Once they caught one, they will tell him that take this gun and join us to fight the soldiers in Gamboru or risk your life. Youths are also being forcefully conscripted into the sect instantly, by giving them N5,000 cash with an AK 47 rifle.

“Residents that refused to join the insurgents are hunted down from house to house for executions through the barrel of the gun or knives and swords.”

According to him, as a result of the killings and threats, several youths have joined the insurgents since Gamboru was captured on August 25, 2014.

Supplies of food and water, he added, had been cut off, as the insurgents had already destroyed the Dikwa-Gambouru/Ngala Bridge last June, while the 102-kilometre Mafa-Dikwa- Gambouru roads cannot be plied, as the insurgents have taken over the border route to Cameroon since the takeover of both Gambouru and Dikwa towns in northern Borno.

Meanwhile, the youths who resisted the conscriptions have abandoned their homes and fled to the Camerounian border town of Fotokol and three other villages.

“I had no alternative other than to join my colleagues by yesterday (Sunday) to flee for our safety. These gunmen had been telling us to join them to fight our soldiers here and at the borders with Cameroun and Chad, after promising us some money and rifles to do the work of God.

“But some of us decided to take our fate in our hands by fleeing to Cameroun. By noon yesterday, about 215 of us converged at Fotokol with broken limbs and bruises, while fleeing to cross the river and bushes with desert tracks. Once they see you fleeing, they shoot you, as we have refused to join them,” one of the fleeing youths said.

He said the target of the insurgents were to “forcefully conscript” youths between the ages of 18 and 25 years.

“They were asking all of us that converge here in Cameroun to join them and fight the soldiers, but we collectively decided not to because these gunmen can never be trusted.”

It has happened not only in Gambouru. Many of the Borno towns and villages were attacked with the displacement of many residents and villagers,” said the youth in a telephone interview from Fotokol.

He said as they reached Fotokol, a Nigerian Air Force, NAF, fighter jet was seen flying over Gombouru, but due to the mixture of innocent civilians and the terrorists in the town and to avoid killing innocent people, the jet bombed targets on the town.

“We had feared that the town was bombarded, by the military to reclaim our town, but one of my parents called me on the phone that they are safe; and there was no bombing from the fighter jet that operated in the area on Sunday morning,” said the youth.”

Military sources in Maiduguri yesterday also said that the aerial surveillance in northern Borno was part of the military operations to reclaim the border town with Cameroon.

The military source was, however, unable to give details of the ongoing military operations launched yesterday.

Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan leaves Abuja today (Monday) for Nairobi to participate in a meeting of the African Union’s Peace and Security Council scheduled to hold in the Kenyan capital tomorrow.

The Nairobi meeting, which is a follow-up to talks by Jonathan and other African leaders at Pretoria, South Africa in May this year on joint action against terrorism, would receive and consider the report of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa.

According to a statement issued yesterday by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Dr. Reuben Abati, deliberations at the Nairobi Summit and the adoption of the African Chairperson’s Report by Jonathan, President Uhuru Kenyatta and other participating Heads of State are expected to lead to more collaborative actions by Nigeria and other African countries to rid the continent of acts of terrorism and violent extremism.

“I can confirm to you that only six people were killed, 10 others injured and 10 houses burnt, which included two mosques.

He added, “The tension in the town arose from a peaceful protest by some women and youths in the area. We have also put the situation under control. The protesters said they wanted soldiers removed from the area.”

The protest was said to have followed an alleged killing of 14 youths by the soldiers. Ten others were also said to have been injured by the police.

The protesters marched to the palace of the traditional ruler of the town, police area command and the police headquarters.

The protesters, who also demanded the relaxation of the 24-hour curfew imposed on the town, accused the soldiers of carrying out extra-judicial killings in the area.

SUNDAY PUNCH gathered that the students were angry that while they had been without electricity for over a month, a hostel for the junior staff of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti, in the same area enjoyed power supply.

The irate students stoned the vehicle of the founder of ABUAD, who was in the car. They also attempted to vandalise the hostel.

The protest caused a traffic gridlock on the road, which stretched over a kilometre.

The arrival of anti-riot policemen, who tried to disperse the students by firing canisters of tear-gas, further provoked them. The students in return threw stones and canisters of the fired tear-gas at the police.

The students, who failed to listen to pleas by the new Ekiti Commissioner of Police, Mr Frederick Lakanu, blocked the Ado-Ijan-Ikare highway.

Commenting on the development, the Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Victor Babayemi, said 30 students were arrested and would be charged to court for breach of public peace.

Many commuters were left stranded. A motorist, who simply gave his name as Mr. Jaye, who was on his way to Nigeria Immigration Service office area narrated his experience to our correspondent.

“I planned to visit my siblings at the Immigration office but I had to return to my house because the traffic was standstill. The students are protesting because we have not had power supply for over a month in Erinfun. All efforts made to the Power Holding Company of Nigeria to address the situation did not yield any response.

“The students are protesting because of the nonchalant attitude of the PHCN,” he said.

The Public Relations Officer of ABUAD, Mr. Tunde Olofintila, confirmed that the protesters attacked Babalola’s vehicle and the hostel.

He said, “They complained that the Erinfun community had not been having power supply for over a month and Chief Afe Babalola, as an elder statesman and one of those who facilitated the siting of the polythenic to the state, decided to intervene.”

“He called the rector of the polytechnic, and asked the students to send three of their representatives to meet with the unit head of the PHCN. They agreed but later said they were not going to meet with the PHCN and started the riot.

“They stoned Chief vehicle and attacked part of the hostel in the community. We had no option but to alert the police, who came to restore normalcy.

“The students and some residents in the area asked why Chief Afe Babalola’s hostel had electricity when the community didn’t have for over a month and we explained to them that the hostel was running on a generator and that it was the PHCN that was responsible for power supply and not Chief Afe Babalola,” Olofintila added.

The robbers who claimed to be his customers, it was gathered, carted away with N3 million.

A colleague of the deceased who did not want his name in print because he was not authorized to speak to journalists, said Ibrahim went to the hotel with N3m for the purpose of transacting business with the said robbers.

It also was learnt that the deceased, a father of three was tricked by robbers into the hotel where he was stabbed to death. He had since been buried according to Islamic rites.

Meanwhile, Kaduna State Police Command on Sunday while confirming the incident said it had commenced a manhunt for the killers of the bureau de change operator (forex trader).

The police spokesman in the state, Superintendent of Police Aminu Lawan, said “information available to us was that a man lodged in the said hotel, and the deceased came with a big polythene bag and requested to see the guest and a call was pulled through to the guest intercom who asked that the deceased be allowed to see him.

“The guest was later joined by another two persons but the three of them left one after the other leaving the deceased in the hotel room, but because it was not time to check out, the receptionist did not bother to question them, but out of curiosity, he had to check the room when the deceased did not come out even after the check out time had passed, only to discover that the room was locked up, it was then he forced open the door only to see the deceased lying lifeless in the pool of his blood before our attention was called upon.”

According to Lawan, the deceased was taken to a hospital where he was medically confirmed death following several stabbing he received on his chest.

He said, preliminary investigation into the matter has started and some people are already being interrogated, adding that manhunt for the killers has already begun.

He lamented that they had always warned their members on the danger of following clients to their houses, hotels or an unknown destination, and wondered why late Ibrahim had to fall a victim."

The hoodlums shot sporadically into the air as soon as they entered the community in the wee hours of Sunday while indigenes of the area were still in bed.

He said that the community fingered Fulani herdsmen as the perpetrators of the violence as a Fulani man had been arrested in a similar incident, where two people were killed in the area. He added that the Fulani admitted that he was paid to attack Mbar.

Maren said that security personnel had been drafted to the community to prevent further loss of lives.

He said that the injured were taken to the Plateau Specialist Hospital and the General Hospital in Barkin Ladi and Bokkos, adding that rescue efforts were still going on to rescue more victims trapped in burning houses.

A member of the House of Representatives and governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC, Emmanuel Jime, was on his way to Katsina/Ala for a thanksgiving service when his advanced team came under attack from armed youths, believed to be supporters of the PDP at Ugbema, the boundary between the two councils.

On Monday morning, it was not clear if the three most injured supporters from Jime’s team would survive as they were said to be under intensive care in an undisclosed hospital.

“I cannot say anybody died at the spot, but if anything later happened, it must have been in the hospital where the critically injured were taken. I saw one person on our team on the ground, whose head was broken with a machete,” said one of Jime’s aides who spoke to The Punch on grounds of anonymity.

Sources also told our correspondent that the PDP youths, who wielded dangerous weapons, were said to have vowed not to allow the opposition campaign any elective position in the area. Hence, a source said the violent attack, which caused a stampede at the head bridge of River Katsina/Ala, is a tributary of River Benue.

Speaking on the development, Jime said, “It was an attack on a group of Okada boys waiting to escort my convoy into Katisna/Ala. They were attacked by thugs, saying they did not want APC in their area. One of my campaign directors had gone in advance to meet with the bikers but he was attacked too. It was not a clash, and to the best of my knowledge, no death occurred.”

However, the state Chairman of the PDP, Emmanuel Agbo, could not be contacted, as his telephone was not picked when he was called to state his position on the matter.

It was learnt that the victims were pursuing some armed robbers when policemen, who were called upon by neighbours to help apprehend the hoodlums, opened fire on them.

The incident which occurred on Friday night threw the residents within the neighbourhood St. Peter’s Anglican Church, Yenagoa into panic.

An eyewitness, who narrated the incident, said people raised the alarm at midnight about an armed robbery attack which was said to be a usual occurrence in the area.

The eyewitness, who wished to be anonymous, said, “The vigilantes responded to the alarm and immediately started chasing the armed robbers away but unknown to them, a neighbour had called the police.

“When the police came and met the vigilantes, two of the police officers opened fire on them, shooting two of them in the stomach.”

Sympathisers from the neighbourhood were said to have thronged to FMC to wish the victims quick recovery.

He added, “When the police asked the men to stop, they refused and instead started running. Then the police shot at them.

“They were disarmed and immediately taken to FMC for treatment. As far as we are concerned, they are suspected armed robbers because we are not aware of a vigilance group in that area.”"

Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association in Plateau State has said two of its members have been killed and about 232 cows stolen in an attack in a Fulani settlement in Jos South LGA of the state.

State chairman of the association, Alhaji Haruna Boro Hussaini, said the attack happened in Rengyel village of Jos South Local Government Area of the state, Sunday evening.

The MACBAN chairman, told newsmen in Jos on Wednesday that the corpses of one of the herders, whom he identified as Saleh Mohammed, 20, has been recovered by officers of the Special Task Force, sector 6 while the second victim, Aminu Inusa, 25, was still missing and presumed dead.

He explained that out of the 232 cattle lost by the association, 50 were shot dead while 182 were rustled into Vom, adding that the cattle belonged to Alhaji Ahmed Muazu, Malam Ruwa Isa and Malam Dauda Umar who are members of the association.

He said, “We have found the corpse of Saleh Mohammed, but Aminu Inusa is still missing and we are assuming he was also killed. The thieves also killed 50 cattle outrightly. We found them all dead with gunshot wounds.

“We have information that the cattle were moved to Vom and the sad part of the incident is that once our cattle are taken to Vom, they don’t come out because even security men are unable to go there and get them.”

He however said they had witnessed a decrease in cattle theft around Riyom and Barkin Ladi after several meetings with community leaders but lamented Jos south is proving to be a challenge despite all such meetings.

Hussaini said, “We no longer see any relevance to the meetings we have been holding with the Berom leaders and the LG Chairman of Jos South since they have refused to put a stop to this. Therefore, we will no longer take part in any meeting with them because it is a waste of time.”"

The policemen led the most senior judge of the court, Justice Daisy Okocha, and some judges into the court premises after a welder cut the iron bars.

The State Judiciary Workers Union has been on strike since June 10 over the crisis rocking the third arm of government in the state.

Some youths, who had gathered in front of the court, protested the action of the policemen as well as the entry of Okocha and the judges into the premises.

They argued that the police had promised not to allow Okocha and other judges to hold any meeting in the court.

It was gathered that Okocha, who was appointed an Administrative Judge by the National Judicial Council in June 2014, had a meeting with the judges in the court.

While the meeting lasted, more angry youths arrived in buses and joined those that had massed in front of the court. More policemen also arrived in Toyota Hilux vans, thereby increasing the tension in the area.

The security operatives were calm until the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Dan Bature, arrived and queried them for allowing the youths to hang around the court premises.

Bature had warned the angry youths to leave in their own interest before making his way into the court premises with some top police officers.

It was at that point that the policemen in about 20 vans fired tear gas canisters to repel the youths, who were believed to be supporters of the Port Harcourt Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mr. Nnamdi Wuche.

Even journalists, who came to cover the incident, passersby and motorists got large doses of the tear gas canisters fired at the youths and into the nearby Port Harcourt Local Government secretariat, where some of them took refuge.

Some of the youths still managed to throw empty bottles at the policemen, ostensibly in retaliation.

Earlier, Wuche had warned that he would mobilise the youths to the court premises if the judges dared to hold a meeting there.

The state Commissioner for Information and Communications, Mrs. Ibim Semenitari, told journalists that it was illegal for Bature to have permitted the forceful entry of the judges into the court premises.

Semenitari stated that the meeting was capable of causing a breakdown of law and order in the state.

She described the incident as a precursor to opening the State House of Assembly and ensuring that six lawmakers impeached Governor Rotimi Amaechi.

She said, “It is surprising that the state police commissioner could superintend over the breaking into the premises of a High Court and in the process, innocent people were attacked with tear gas. Journalists who came to see what was happening were attacked.

“Breaking into the Rivers State High Court cannot be said to be one of the functions of the state police commissioner. On what basis would the CP order the forceful entry into the state high court? On what basis would Justice Okocha break into the High Court that has been under lock and key by striking judiciary workers?

“We appeal to the Federal Government to focus on its work and bring back the (Chibok) girls. We urge the Federal Government to ensure that INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission) conducts free and fair elections and we also appeal to the Federal Government to bring back the economy of the country.

“Rivers State cannot be turned into a police state again. There are speculations that the forceful opening of the high court was a precursor to opening the state House of Assembly with the aim of allowing six members of the assembly to impeach Governor Amaechi.”

Also, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Worgu Boms, said in a statement that “the judiciary workers had embarked on strike in relation to the chief judge issue and secured and locked up the court premises whereupon some persons went there to effect a breakage of the premises to enable the said Justice Okocha to enter and have a meeting.

“This serious security breach can provoke a reaction from the striking workers and may attract other politically-interested persons to the crisis and thus lead to another series of crises.”

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, said the judges applied for protection and police obliged them.

Mohammad explained that the police fired tear gas canisters when the youths began to throw stones and bottles at them .

He said, “The judges applied to the commissioner of police for security. The commissioner of police obliged and ordered for the deployment of policemen in the place (court). The 1999 Constitution demands that the police should protect lives and property.

“If this group of people came to protest against the meeting of the judges, I don’t know why they should. They (youths) started hurling stones and bottles at policemen. We cannot just keep quiet like that. We must protect ourselves before we protect anybody.

“Nobody was arrested. They were only dispersed after several warnings. What happened there (meeting of the judges) is not our business. We only provided security there since they applied for protection.”

The crisis in the state judiciary could be traced to the appointment by Amaechi of Justice Peter Agumagu of the Customary Appeal Court as Chief Judge.

Agumagu was suspended by the National Judicial Council, which named Okocha as the acting chief judge or administrative judge of the state.

This development did not go down well with the Rivers State Government.

Agumagu was suspended for allegedly going against the NJC’s directive that no judge in Rivers State should accept to be acting chief judge based on Amaechi’s appointment.

Agumagu’s appointment was in February voided by a Federal High Court presided by Justice Lambo Akanbi, which ruled that by the provisions of the law, only the most senior judge in the state judiciary could be appointed as Acting Chief Judge.

Ten persons have been killed and 40 houses set ablaze in a fresh attack on Eggon community of Gidan Gambo in Lafia East Development Area of Nasarawa State by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.

Investigation by one of our correspondents indicated that the attackers, well armed with AK 47 rifles, defied early morning rain and attacked the village, killing 10 persons, injuring scores, and burnt 40 houses.

Our correspondents gathered that the attack on Gidan Gambo is the latest among the various attacks on Eggon communities carried out by Fulani insurgents since hostilities broke out between the warring parties in the state.

Speaking to our correspondent in Gidan Gambo, a resident, Likita Alaku, who said he managed to run away from the attack, said that the Fulani, numbering over 400 and armed with AK 47 rifles, stormed the village at about 6am and opened fire and killed 10 people.

‘’We wake up with a heavy rain and saw many Fulani people with AK 47 rifles surrounded the village and started shooting in all directions and burning houses,’’ he stated.

Alaku, who expressed worry over the sophisticated weapon in possession of the invading Fulani, advised the federal and state governments and security agencies to disarm the gunmen to prevent them from attacking innocent people further.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Nasarawa State Police Command, Assistant Superintendent of Police Umaru Ismaila Numan, who confirmed the incident, said only one person was killed in the attack.

H e said the command had already mobilised its men to the scene of the incident in order to restore normalcy to the trouble area.

But further investigation by one of our correspondents revealed that about three bodies, who were killed in the recent crisis between Eggon, Fulani cattle breeders and Alago were found in some parts of Keana Local Government Area of the state decomposing. However, they were buried in the early hours of Tuesday by the inhabitants of the area.

Confirming the incident to one of our correspondents in a telephone interview in Lafia, the state capital, the PPRO said some people in Keana LGA reported the incident to the command, saying they found three bodies of unidentified persons in their area.

It also allegedly features Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau, a man the military has claimed to have killed last year. Two weeks ago, the military said they had killed in battle a Shekau lookalike who had posed in the group’s videos.

“Here I am, alive and I will remain alive until the day Allah takes away my breath,” the man says in the Hausa language. “Even if you kill me … it will not stop us imposing Islamic rule … We are still in our Islamic state, reigning and teaching the Koran.”

The United States still has a $7m ransom on Shekau’s head, despite the death claims.

The video was made available to The Associated Press through the same channels used previously and seems to show the same man claiming to be Shekau.

In the latest video, he says they are prosecuting in accordance with Shariah law in areas under their control. Examples of punishments are shown, including the stoning to death of a man apparently accused of adultery; the amputation of the hand of a young man accused of theft; the lashings of a man and what appears to be a girl covered in the hijab.

The video ends with a show of burnt out plane parts in rugged bush.

Two pilots and an Alpha jet have been missing since September 11 when it left Yola, Adamawa State, on a bombing mission against Boko Haram.

The video shows a kneeling man in a camouflage vest with his right hand in a sling, with a fighter hovering over him with an axe, which is later used in the beheading.

Speaking in English, the victim identifies himself as a Wing Commander in the Nigerian Air Force and says he was undertaking a mission in Kauri area of Borno State on September 11.

“We were shot down and our aircraft crashed,” he says, appearing to keep his composure throughout the ordeal. “To this day, I don’t know the whereabouts of my second pilot.”

Shekau claims in the video to have brought down 10 military aircraft.

The Defense Headquarters has denied speculation that Boko Haram brought down a helicopter gunship that crashed in August. The pilot died, two crew members survived."

Goodhope, a primary six pupil of Nkek Standard Primary School, Nkek, was abducted in his father’s home around 7pm on Tuesday.

An eyewitness, Mr. Ekong Fitsgerald told our correspondent on Wednesday at Nkek that the vehicle, in which the hoodlums were going away with the lad, fell into a ditch, and that, he added, prompted him to struggle for attention from the passers-by for assistance.

He stated that when the hoodlums noticed that some members of the community had caught sight of the lad as he was struggling with loud screaming accompanied with heavy banging of the vehicle, the kidnappers began to shoot in the air to scare vigilant youths who had quickly mobilized and started chasing them.

He added that when the kidnappers later knew that they would not be able to remove the vehicle, they abandoned their victim, who was beginning to give them some trouble, as well as the vehicle to take refuge in a nearby bush.

He said, “The men were about four. Nobody knew that they had kidnapped someone.

“If not that luck ran out of them after the vehicle fell into the ditch, they would have escaped with their victim. As the hoodlums were struggling to remove the vehicle from the ditch, the lad screamed and used his legs to bang the vehicle that attracted the youths’ attention.”

He stated that with quick response from the police in Ukanafun, the DPO together with his men went after the hoodlums in the bush and eventually captured two of the fleeing kidnappers.

It was learnt that the two suspects were currently helping the police with clues on how to apprehend the other members of the gang; and one of them is said to be an in-law to the father of the victim, Mr. Aniekan Brownson.

The father of the victim thanked God and the Nigeria Police Force for not allowing the hoodlums make away with his child.

Aniekan, a school teacher, who was in deep shock on hearing that his brother in-law was alleged to have masterminded the kidnap of his son, wondered what might have necessitated the act considering the fact that he has nothing which could have attracted the kidnappers.

He appealed to the police to fish out the other members of the gang and ensure that justice takes its course.

Nkek community council chairman, Chief Friday Okonko, condemned the acts of criminality in the community.

He, however, commended the youths for their vigilance and urged them to continue to do their best to protect the community against the activities of criminal-minded persons.

The attackers were said to have stormed the camps of the refugees who were mainly from the neighbouring Gwoza town of Borno State in the night.

One of the refugees, who escaped the onslaught, said the gunmen were still in the vicinity of their camps and have continued to chase them.

""We were asleep under trees. Some of us were in schools when they came. Up till this time, many of them are still hiding in some locations, as they continue to chase our people.

""They seized women and gathered them in one place. They killed many people, even though the security tried to repel them, but to no avail. But they are still in the town,"" he said.

Asked on the identities of the victims, he said ""we cannot ascertain the security casualties, but they killed many of our people.""

Another person narrated that ""we are unable to bury corpses and the security cannot march to them, because they outnumbered the security here.

""If we attempt to hold funeral for the slain ones, they fire shots at us. And they continue to fire sporadically.

""The security around here were very few and they did their best against the attackers who have not run,"" he explained.

When he was asked whether they could walk out of the area, the refugee replied that ""if you walk the Cameroon security will tag you Boko Haram. That is how it has been."""

Operation Zenda, the Benue State task force on security, comprising the military and the police, clashed with members of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Gas Workers in Makurdi, the state’s capital, causing confusion in the metropolis on Friday.

It was learnt that trouble started when a tanker driver spit on a traffic officer who was directing the flow of traffic along the only road leading out of the state capital to the southern part of the country.

An eyewitness, who identified himself as Ahir, told The PUNCH that a motorist with a smaller car blocked the road before the tanker driver arrived.

The truck driver was said to have attempted to force his way through contrary to the direction of the traffic warden.

Ahir said an argument ensued between the traffic officer and the tanker driver, who allegedly spit on traffic warden, a development that coincided with the arrival of men of Operation Zenda.

Operatives of the joint security task force were said to have descended on the truck driver and beat him to a pulp.

NUPENG officials and other tanker drivers were said to have been alerted to the fate of their colleagues.

The union officials were alleged to have blocked the highway with their trucks in reaction to the beating of their colleague.

The state chairman of NUPENG, Joseph Hungur, told The PUNCH at the scene of the blockade that the state treasurer of the Union, Mr. Abdullahi Ibrahim, lost a tooth when the security operatives attacked him.

He said, “My treasurer lost one of his teeth and has been whisked away; at the same time, some of our workers are already in detention and I cannot tell them to move away because it will look as if I am acting in connivance with the security operatives.”

This is happening just as the fuel scarcity in the state continues to bite harder while black marketers continue to make huge sales from the scarcity."

Saturday PUNCH learnt from a source who pleaded anonymity that a protest against the seizure of a ceiling fan belonging to an inmate degenerated into the riot which might have claimed the lives of a number of the prisoners.

Our source, who witnessed the incident, said the shooting started around 1.30pm.

He said, “Someone brought in a ceiling fan for an inmate referred to as the ‘general-overseer’ of the prison’s Christian denomination. But the fan was seized by the officer in-charge of the prisons, who also allegedly ordered the inmate detained.

“The inmate said he was the owner of the ceiling fan and only sent it out of the prison for repairs.”

According to this source, the inmate was later released after protests by his colleagues who felt he was being unjustly punished. But the situation was said to have degenerated beyond control, necessitating the intervention of soldiers at the prisons.

“By the time the inmate was released, the other prisoners had started throwing stones at windows and getting violent. The soldiers shot sporadically at the inmates as they ran into their cells, but many of them were hit,” our source said.

As of the time of filing this report, there was no confirmation on the actual number of prisoners killed but our source claimed to have seen the dead bodies of a number of inmates and some injured prisoners with bullet wounds being transported to the hospital within the prison.

But the spokesperson for the Nigerian Prisons Service, Mr. Ope Fatinikun, told our correspondent on the phone that there was indeed a riot at the prison, which he claimed was not violent.

He said, “No inmate was shot at, but 12 of them who sustained minor injuries have been given treatment.

“If anybody tells you he saw dead bodies of shot inmates, he should provide pictures. We have passed that stage something like that could not have happened without someone getting a picture.”

It was learnt that his assailants shot him in the head as he alighted from his car near his residence off Otiotio Road about 10pm.

Sources said Akpen, who was from Ofoni in Sagbama Local Government Area of the state reportedly died on the spot.

The armed men were said to have fled the scene of the crime without collecting any valuable from their victim.

Last week, the state government, after its 21st State Security Council Meeting in Yenagoa, had said it was making concerted efforts to tackle criminal acts such as sea piracy, thuggery and brigandage ahead of the 2015 general elections.

Governor Seriake Dickson had vowed during the opening of the meeting that the days of militias and gun-running were over, stressing that the institutions of state would not succumb to partisanship and undue pressure.

Commissioner of Police in the state, Valentine Ntomchukwu, confirmed the killing of the BYSIEC high ranking official.

Ntomchukwu suspected it might be a case of assassination as the hoodlums did not remove any of his valuables.

“In my opinion, it may be a case of assassination because they didn’t take anything away after killing him,” the police boss noted.

The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Celestina Kalu, told SUNDAY PUNCH that Frances was attacked and shot as she left a bank at JW Junction along Ovie Palace Rd, where she had gone to withdraw some money for her father.

The PPRO said though the robbers escaped with a box of cloths in the booth of the car of the deceased, they left the money she had gone to withdraw intact in the middle box of her car.

Kalu said, “One Mrs. Sovex Oneya had come to the station and reported that at 11:30hrs, her sister in-law, Frances Oneya, daughter of retired Brig. Gen. Dominic Oneya, informed her that her father sent her to Zenith Bank to withdraw the sum of N200,000.

“Thirty minutes later she received a call that Frances had been shot by armed robbers operating in Toyota Picnic car with unknown registration number at Ovie Palace Road, Effurun.

“The corpse has been deposited at Venee Mortuary Warri. At the scene, N200,000 was recovered in the middle box of the victim’s vehicle and the vehicle towed to the police station.

“At the scene, information gathered revealed that the hoodlums went away with the victim’s bag in the booth of the vehicle containing some pieces of cloths, which the hoodlums thought was the money she withdrew.”

The deceased was a mother of four.

On her Facebook page on Saturday, Frances’ friends paid tribute to her, describing her as a trusted and principled woman.

Our correspondent gathered that the armed hoodlums, numbering over 100, forced their way into the premises, located at Iyama Road at about 6.30am after overpowering the security guards at the gate, and vandalised no fewer than 30 vehicles, suspected to belong to the All Progressives Congress lawmakers.

Some of the buildings occupied by the lawmakers were also vandalised, causing the occupants to scamper for safety.

When our correspondent visited the scene, some of the windows were shattered while bullet holes could be seen in some of the vehicles and doors.

The Edo State Governor, Adams Oshiomhole, who arrived at the scene of the incident at about 11am, and was conducted round the quarters by the Speaker, Uyi Igbe, condemned the attack on the lawmakers and their family members.

Oshiomhole also blamed the Peoples Democratic Party for masterminding the mayhem, taking a swipe at the Nigerian Police, whom he said “granted permission” for the attack.

Addressing newsmen after the inspection, Oshiomhole said, “The PDP leaders had a meeting where it was decided that thugs should be recruited using one Idehen to perpetrate this attack.

Oshiomhole said, “It is very clear that the Police granted permission for this attack because the Commissioner of Police was informed at about 10pm last night of the plan of the PDP to attack the legislative quarters and the APC office.

“We made this intelligence available to the Commissioner of Police and what we then saw was that even the minimal police presence here was vacated so that these thugs could have a free reign of terror.

“And this morning, when they assembled at a point they were meant to assemble and even this fact was conveyed to the CP last night that they were going to assemble at George Idah Primary School.

“They actually assembled at George Idah Primary School this morning before they proceeded and the police provided supervision for this very serious criminal act. It is very clear that the police command leadership granted permission to PDP to carry out this heinous crime.”

The governor also lamented that the PDP in the state sought to make the state ungovernable, rather than share the concern of the President, who is a member of the party, to address the challenges of insurgency in the country.

He said, “I think for all Nigerians, at a time when we are confronted by insurgency and other forms of violent crime, one will expect that any functionary of the other party will share the concern of the President on peace and security.

“You can see some of the PDP leaders in Edo State, having lost out and rejected by the people, believe that they can create a situation that will make Edo State ungovernable and create complete distraction in their futile calculation that they can remove themselves from power.

“This is a very dangerous thing. I am not so much worried about the violent character of the PDP, I am more worried by what seems to be the police readiness to provide them with cover.”

On the notion that the invasion might not be unconnected with an earlier attack on Tuesday on a member of the state House of Assembly, Mr Rasaq Momoh, who was currently receiving treatment at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, the governor said, “You will recall that during the local government Election, Razak Momoh was arrested by the police with two guns; a pistol and a double barrel gun. As of that time during that local government election, he was still a member of ACN (Action Congress of Nigeria).

“When he was arrested and the facts were brought to my attention, I asked the police to ensure that he was prosecuted according to law. He was remanded by court in prison for four months before he was granted bail and as we speak, that matter is pending at the High Court”

“About six months before the election, Razak was shot by his own fellow criminals and he was taken to the hospital.

I have insisted, and I still do, that everyone who has committed crime must be prosecuted according to the law of the land.

“The fact that he is a lawmaker makes it imperative for him to be seen to obey the law and the police told me, then, that when he was arrested, he asked the police, ‘Do you know who I am? I am a member of the Edo House of Assembly’, and the police had to remind him that he didn’t have immunity.”

But the police were quick to say that it would not “join issues with anybody.”

However, the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Foluso Adebanjo, told our correspondent on telephone that the state command had arrested 12 persons in connection with the Saturday attack.

He also claimed that the vehicle purported to have been used to convey the attackers had been recovered, assuring that more arrests would be made.

“We do not want to join issues with anybody. All I can say is that we have arrested about 12 persons and the vehicle that they used, we have recovered it,” he said."

One of the traders, Ebere Okafor, told our correspondent that the hoodlums broke into her shops and carted away expensive hair attachments.

“They took many weavons. They didn’t go for the synthetic weavons.

“They went for the Brazilian and Peruvian ones,” She said.

But a leader in the street, Omuwa Elegun popularly known as “Madam Lagos” blamed the killing and robbery on the rivalry between the two families over revenue collection.

Elegun said one of the guards was taken to an enclosed area where he was killed.

Elegun said, “The area boys are causing this. Some of them want to eat beyond what they are required to collect. They are extorting money from the people. The chairman said the money collected from the traders is too high.”

“Those of us assigned to collect revenue don’t collect up to N100. Shops in my house were broken into. They dragged the guard somewhere and killed him.”

The road is said to be the same one where the Emir of Gwoza, Idrissa Timta, was killed a few months ago.

The sect was also said to have attacked and killed people at Abadam village around the Lake Chad area in Borno State and Gava III of Gwoza Local Government Area and were said to be in full control of the village as of Sunday.

The latest round of Boko Haram atrocities followed the invasion of Sondi village in Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State, where some gunmen killed no fewer than 14 people.

According to the Executive Director of Stefanos Foundation, Mr. Mark Lipdo, the sect, after slaughtering their victims in the Borno community, where the Emir of Gwoza was killed months ago, left the lifeless bodies lying on the spot for a long time.

Lipdo, quoting sources from the area, said the insurgents had occupied the community, preventing relatives from taking their slain relatives.

He said in an effort to remove the bodies, a young man was shot as he attempted to retrieve his father’s body.

He is said to be presently receiving treatment in a hospital in Biu.

Lipdo said, “Information says in spite of the ceasefire agreement with the insurgents, at about 12 and 1pm, six innocent civilians were held hands bound and slaughtered on the Biu-Garkida road of Borno State yesterday (Friday).

2363,Thugs attack NLC chairman in Rivers,10/22/2014,,Port Harcourt,Rivers,0,,,,Other Armed Actor,,,,Election-related Actor,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,Government Building,,,,,,,http://www.punchng.com/news/thugs-attack-nlc-chairman-in-rivers/,,,4.801559925,7.025010109,"Port Harcourt, Rivers, Nigeria",Nigeria,"A group of youths suspected to be hired thugs on Wednesday attacked the Rivers State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress, Dr. Chris Oruge.

Oruge was beaten up by the youths, who stormed his office during the meeting of the state executive of the NLC held in Port Harcourt.

It was learnt that top officials of the labour union had expressed dissatisfaction over Oruge’s refusal to leave office as the chairman after he was suspended by the Nigeria Union of Teachers, his parent union.

Eyewitnesses disclosed that the state NLC boss was left with injuries to his face and torn clothes after the attack by the angry youths.

But the Vice Chairman of the state NLC, Mr. Williams Addah, told newsmen that contrary to the claim in some quarters, Oruge was not beating thugs, but was prevented from gaining entrance to his office.

Addah said, “What actually happened was that there was a SEC meeting this morning at the instance of the state chairman of NLC and when we got there, there was information that he had been suspended from his primary industrial union, that is NUT. The suspension letter read May 28, 2013, and we didn’t know and he hid it.

“We all know that NLC membership is by union; it is not by individual. So, the moment you are suspended or you are no longer having any dealings with your union, you seize to hold any office in NLC.

“Your primary union is a platform for which you can stay to pivot any affairs of NLC. So, since he has been suspended, he has nothing to do with NLC again. We were not aware until recently and we investigated and it was so. We were able to clamp down on the documents.

“At the meeting, a motion was raised that since his union has suspended him, he cannot continue to be chairman of NLC any longer. So, in his place, the vice chairman in-charge of administration, Comrade Prince Williams Addah, should take over, and act pending when he clears himself with his primary industrial union. So, the motion was carried.”

However, several attempts to reach Oruge was not successful as his mobile phone was switched off when our correspondent called, even as security operatives continued to mount surveillance at the state NLC secretariat on D-Line in Port Harcourt.

Meanwhile, a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has denied the traditional ruler of Rumueprikom community in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area, Eze Anthony Owabie, over an alleged illegal possession of firearms.

Owabie was arrested on August 13, 2014 by security operatives for purportedly shooting at his son during a political crisis in his community.

Justice Uche Agumuo, who presided over the matter, said on Wednesday that the accused would not be granted bail in order to protect him from being attacked.

Agumuo said granting the monarch bail could spark a fresh crisis in Rumueprikom community, adding that the medical report of his illness was not enough grounds to release him on bail.

He, however, directed that the matter should be given an accelerated hearing beginning from October 27, November 3, 10, 11, and 12, 2014.

Counsel for the accused person, Mr. Emenike Ebete, told newsmen that the main suit to determine if Owabie was guilty of the charges against him would soon commence"

Boko Haram has renamed Gwoza town in Borno State which it captured, as part of a campaign to establish a caliphate in the North-eastern region, residents who have fled in recent days told AFP on Thursday.

The Islamists seized the town of Mubi in Adamawa State last week and now insist it be called Madinatul Islam, or “City of Islam” in Arabic.

Gwoza in neighbouring Borno State which was captured in July is now being called Darul Hikma or “House of Wisdom,” multiple residents said.

Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, in a video released in August declared that he had made Gwoza part of a caliphate — an announcement that recalled a similar move by the Islamic State militant group which has taken over parts of Iraq and Syria.

The extremists are believed to control more than two dozen towns and villages in the North-east and there are signs that they are trying to advance south towards Adamawa’s capital Yola.

“They have given new names to Gwoza and Mubi, which they say are now part of their Islamic State,” said Ahmad Maishanu, who fled Mubi with his mother on Wednesday to Yola.

Tijjani Kalifa, who left Mubi on Monday and has contacts in Gwoza, also reported that Boko Haram was forcing people in both towns to use the new names.

Both witnesses said all the churches in Mubi had been burnt down and that Islamists were patrolling the streets regularly, with no sign of resistance from the security services.

The renaming of Gwoza is coming as Senator Maina Maaji Lawan on Thursday said 21 persons were killed after the insugents clashed with soldiers in Malam Fatori, Borno State, Wednesday.

Malam Fatori is a commercial hub known for fishing and farming in the remote part of the state, near the border with Niger Republic.

“Boko Haram tried to attack Malam Fatori... but they met stiff resistance from the Multi-National Joint Task Force who initially repelled the attack after prolonged fighting,” said Lawan.

“They pushed back the insurgents and people in the town and the soldiers thought it was over but the insurgents mobilised more men and weapons including an armoured personnel carrier (APC) and launched a renewed attack.

“They overpowered the soldiers who were forced to flee.

The insurgents went into the town shooting indiscriminately. They killed 21 people.”

According to AFP, local residents put the civilian death toll at 16 and claimed that dozens of militants were killed in the initial military response on the ground and from the air.

Aminu Ahmad, who lives in the Abadam Local Government Area, of which Malam Fatori is the biggest town, estimated that “hundreds” of heavily armed Boko Haram fighters arrived in a convoy of pick-up trucks.

“Honestly, it was a bad outing for the insurgents because dozens of them were killed,” he said.

The troops involved were from Nigeria, Chad and Niger and were stationed nearby.

The multi-national force was set up in the late 1990s to fight cross-border crime and arms trafficking but its responsiblity was expanded to include Boko Haram, when the insurgency started in 2009.

The fighting forced thousands of people to flee the area across the border, said residents and Lawan, who represents northern Borno in the upper house of parliament.

“The town was deserted as a result of the attack and thousands of people crossed into Niger and are now camped in Bosso town which is only five kilometres (three miles) away,” he said.

“Malam Fatori is a big commercial centre in the region with a reputation of farming and fishing centre. The displacement of the people will have adverse effect on the town."

, Nasarawa, Nigeria",Nigeria,"Twelve people were feared injured and over eight vehicles vandalised on Thursday as supporters of the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party clashed in Nasarawa State.

The incident occurred when one of the vehicles on Alhaji Yusus Agabi’s convoy was attacked. Agabi is one of the governorship aspirants in the state who was on his way to the PDP’s secretariat.

In a reprisal, the PDP supporters reportedly pounced on a vehicle belonging to the APC, injuring 12 people in the process while eight vehicles were vandalised.

The situation caused heavy traffic on the Jos-Makurdi road, leaving commuters travelling through Lafia-Makurdi and Enugu for the eastern part of the country stranded. Passengers going to Kano, Kaduna and the Federal Capital Territory were also stranded for hours.

Speaking to our correspondent, one of the passengers, Musa Haruna, who ran into the traffic snarl, expressed worry about the situation caused by the clash.

Some hoodlums, who took law into their hands in the name of a political rally, also compounded the situation.

The confusion, which lasted for several hours, also caused panic in the state. It left the Majority Leader of the state House of Assembly, Mr. Godiya Akwahiki, representing Nasarawa North Constituency, stranded until the intervention of security agents who paved the way for the people to pass.

An eyewitness account revealed that some APC thugs attacked the convoy of one of the governorship aspirants on the platform of the PDP, Agabi, who was going to inform the state chairman of the party of his intention to summit his nomination form in Abuja tomorrow (today).

A source told our correspondent that the attack on the APC vehicle, which was passing through PDP secretariat, was a reprisal.

According to another eyewitness account, it was the intervention of the security operatives who quickly mobilised their men to the scene that brought the situation under control. He said otherwise, the secretariat would have been set ablaze by the hoodlums.

Investigation by our correspondent revealed that those injured were taken to Dalhatu Specialist Hospital, Dash, for treatment.

He said the insurgents used the Potiskum attack that led to the death of about 47 school children to divert attention, so that while the authorities’ attention was on Yobe state, the insurgents struck Mahia, leading to the killing of several people who refused to flee after Mubi was attacked.

According to him , even before Mahia was overrun by the Boko Haram insurgents, it had been rendered a ghost of itself as commercial and social activities were paralyzed as a result of exodus of people from the town occasioned by attacks on Mubi which is 20km away.

Fleeing residents of Mahia, who spoke to ThisDay on telephone said nobody anticipated that the insurgents would overrun the town, adding that insurgents had been convincing the people not to run away but promised to provide them with security and better life.

He said the killings and destruction orchestrated by the insurgents in Mahia violated their promise to the people by the insurgents to protect them

No fewer than 80 members of the dreaded Boko Haram sect were said to have been killed on Tuesday by local hunters in Mahia area of Adamawa State.

It was learnt from one of the local hunters, who was part of the team that engaged the terrorist group in a fierce battle, that they were angered by Monday’s attack on their town, deciding to move against the terrorists.

The local hunters, who spoke on condition of anonymity to our correspondent on Wednesday, said they mobilised local hunters from surrounding towns to engage the insurgents and they were successful in recapturing their town.

He said, “We fought gallantly, killed 80 members of the insurgents and recaptured Mahia Local Government headquarters (from their control).”

He boasted that if given the chance by the military authorities, the hunters would have dispersed the insurgents from all the captured areas of Adamawa and beyond.

He said, “The military kept telling us that we cannot be allowed to go after the insurgents since we are not legally constituted.

“We can only appeal to the military authorities to scrutinise us and authorise us to face the Boko Haram insurgents in a battle which I believed we will defeat the insurgents and regain our land.

“If the military can authorise us and give us back-ups, we will wipe out the insurgents because we know their hideouts and if it is juju (local charms), we will match them it.

“Boko Haram fear us because they know what we can do. Let the military leave us with Boko Haram and see what is going to happen. We took advantage of the fact that the soldiers have fled the area and used the opportunity to kill and chase some of the insurgents out of Mahia.”"

Men of the Special Task Force on security in Plateau State, otherwise known as ‘Operation Safe Haven’, foiled an attempt to kidnap three ladies by gunmen in Jos on Wednesday.

The development came as some armed men abducted Mr. Sanusi Noma, the son the former Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party in Bauchi State, Alhaji Garba Noma.

STF Media Officer, Capt. Ikedichi Iweha, said in a statement in Jos on Thursday that the incident took place at about 11.37pm on Wednesday when three unidentified gunmen forcefully ordered three young ladies into a commercial tricycle otherwise known as Keke NAPEP at the West of Mines general area of Jos North, a popular joint in the Jos metropolis.

The gunmen were said to have directed the tricycle operator to drive towards the Farin Gada area also in Jos North but were intercepted around Utan area by a snap checkpoint mounted by operatives of the STF.

He said, “On sighting the checkpoint, the tricycle operator jumped out hurriedly to report to troops allowing the kidnappers an opportunity to escape into a nearby crowd in the darkness, firing indiscriminately and abandoning their victims. Troops were restrained from opening fire to avoid needless loss of lives or injury to innocent bystanders and unnecessary damage to property.

Iweha added, “In the resulting chase by personnel of the STF, the gunmen were forced to abandon a bag containing one locally made pistol, one locally made SMG riffle, three cutlasses and a small hand knife.”

The STF spokesman said efforts were ongoing to apprehend the gunmen.

Meanwhile, the son of the Bauchi PDP former chairman was abducted at the early hours of Thursday in front of his father’s residence in the Bauchi metropolis.

The Bauchi state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Haruna Mohammed, who confirmed the incident, said, “At the early hours of today (Thursday), the son of former PDP state chairman Jarman Bauchi,one Sanusi Garba Noma, male, was abducted by yet to be identified persons."

Five persons were also alleged to have been missing while several vehicles were destroyed by angry youths in the clash between Okrika people and their counterparts from Onne.

Eyewitnesses said that a group of youths from Okrika had begun a peaceful protest at about 5.30am over the Federal Government’s refusal to recognise their area as a host community.

The protesters, who marched towards the Oil and Gas Free Zone, blocked the main entrance to the seaport, a development that start panic among workers within the place.

John recalled that the people of Okrika had been appealing for their community to be listed among host communities, maintaining that the expansion of the Federal Ocean Terminal made the facility to extend to Okrikaland.

“It is unfortunate that we are not recognised as a host community while Ogu and Onne are listed as host communities. This is not fair because the expansion of FOI makes the facility to extend to Okrika.

Aisha Wakaso in Minna

Street urchins, known as ‘Area Boys’, in Minna caused panic in the town on Monday, making residents to scamper for safety, mistaking their activities for that of the terrorists group, Boko Haram.

The two groups went to Limawa Primary and Secondary School to fight, while pupils were still in school and on sighting the area boys fighting with weapons, students and teachers took to their heels, thinking it was Boko Haram.

The hoodlums were said to have injured some students with their cutlasses, knives and clubs. Some also got injured in the process of running for their safety, while some of the area boys also got injured in the process.

Residents of Minna rushed to the schools to pick up their children and wards as the rumour spread around the town that Boko Haram had attacked a school.

When contacted, the state Commissioner of Police, Olusola Emmanuel Amore, dispelled the rumours of Boko Haram’s presence in Minna, explaining that some residents mistook the activities of street urchins that clashed near a public school in Kpagungu area of the city for terrorists attack.

He said the police had arrested seven suspects in connection with the clash, adding that they will be made to face the full wrath of the law and that there will be no compromise.

While appealing to the media not to spread rumours of Bako Haram in Minna, the commissioner said the command was doing everything possible to eradicate such hostilities among warring communities in the city.

Amore said the police had reconciled the warring communities of Limawa and Agwan Daji, through dialogue involving traditional rulers and elders of the communities, adding that the same method of peaceful resolution would be applied in the case of Soji and Kpagungu communal clashes.

He said, we have arrested seven of them and they will be prosecuted. We are going after the gang leaders and we will soon get them. I want to appeal to the people to be vigilant as internal vigilance is the prize of liberty.

He warned those serving as patrons to the hoodlums to stop their nefarious acts, adding that the police will soon carry out inspection raids and any of them caught will be prosecuted.

He said the police was set to rid the state of thugs before the 2015 general election, adding that all criminals must vacate the state or face the wrath of the law."

Over 10 people were injured as Peoples Democratic Party elders scampered for safety when violence broke out during a stakeholders’ meeting at Ikot Akpa Nkuk, in Ukanafun Local Government Area, of Akwa Ibom State.

Our correspondent gathered that the stakeholders’ meeting, which held on Tuesday evening, was organised by the elders of the area to douse the tension, following moves by some people to truncate the zoning of political offices in the area.

Things came to a head when the Divisional Police Officer of the area, Friday Mkpa, said that though he approved the hosting of the meeting, he could no longer ensure its continuation as a result of a security report.

An indigene and a Peoples Democratic Party member, Mr. Okon Etim, said there were over 50 security officials at the venue to provide protection to members of the meeting.

Etim explained that tempers boiled over when the DPO unceremoniously called off the meeting even as thugs allegedly sponsored by an aspirant not favourably disposed to zoning invaded the venue.

It was gathered that elders at the high table were beaten up by the rampaging youths.

Etim added that the thugs that were led by three youth leaders in Ukanafun beat up a former Councillor for Ward 1, Mr. Uko Idiong. He added that the thugs also tore his clothes.

He stated that the convener of the meeting, Abong Ukokah, was not spared in the assault perpetrated by the thugs. He noted that property worth millions of naira was destroyed.

“Anything that happened at Ukanafun on Tuesday is to be blamed on the DPO. He had more than 50 police officials at the venue. For him to call off the meeting on the excuse that he could not guarantee the security of the place is ridiculous.”

‎The bullion van and the escort vehicle were found ridden with bullets in the incident which was said to have occurred at about 4:50pm and the armed men made away with the cash supposedly belonging to United Bank for Africa.

An eye witness told journalists that the policemen were caught unawares after the armed robbers shot sporadically at the police escorts’ van and the bullion van simultaneously.

He explained that the policemen and the driver of the van took to their heels immediately the hoodlums opened fire on them, noting that some of the occupants of the van would have been hit by bullets in the process.

He stated that the operation lasted for just about seven minutes, even as the agrarian community was turned into a ghost town while the operation lasted as no member of the community could withstand the superior ammunitions of the robbers.

“The speed breaker erected on the highway helped the armed men. They overtook the vans and open fire on the policemen before they could realise what was going on. The men are better equipped because they operated with confidence,” the source said.

However, a middle aged man, simply identified as Pastor Ajah who was coming from Ondo town ran into the rain of bullets and sustained bullet wounds.

Ajah, a school proprietor in the area, was said to be coming from a mechanic workshop in Ondo town with his Toyota Sienna Bus with registration Number AA733FTD‎ when he ran into the hoodlums who opened fire on him and his car. He is said to have been taken to the general hospital.

They were seen driving away in a red car through an untarred road linking the area with Ile Oluji, a neighbouring town.

Ondo State police commissioner, Isaac Eke, described the attack as shocking, his men said had launched a manhunt to track and arrest the robbers.

According to Eke, the command suspects conspiracy i‎n the attack, noting that official bookings of security was not made at the police Operations Department before the assignment was carried out, ‎saying conspiracy would not be ruled out in the attack.

He also noted that none of the police escorts in the convoy had reported to the station and their whereabouts remain unknown as of the time of filing this report.

The Police boss vowed that his men would soon arrest and bring the hoodlums to book urging all law abiding citizens to go about their lawful business."

By Oladele Ogunsola, Correspondent, Ibadan.

Dark era of political thuggery and violence reared its ugly head in Ibadan on Friday at the last lap of ‘Meet the people’ tour of the governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi during which a policeman was killed and another one injured.

Confirming the incident, the state Police Command spokesperson, Olabisi Ilobanefor disclosed that the state Commissioner of Police, Kola Sodipo was pained by the incident and that he had vowed to deal ruthlessly with political thuggery and hooliganism in the state.

The Oyo Police Command spokesperson, who said 18 suspects were arrested at Oke-Padre in Ibadan North-West Local Government area of the state where the violence occurred said the suspects would be thoroughly investigated and whoever found to be involved would face the full wrath of the law.

Ilobanefor hinted that the command was fully prepared for the challenges ahead as far as the 2015 general elections were concerned and urged the various political parties to warn their supporters as no act of brigandage before, during and after the election would be tolerated.

Meanwhile, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has lamented the violence, said to have occurred on the last day of the tour of the state governor, Ajimobi.

The party said its rank was infiltrated by thugs wearing the party’s vests as it distanced itself from the violence in a reaction issued by its Publicity Secretary, Wale Shadare.

According to the party, “the opposition parties, apparently overwhelmed by the success of the governor’s ‘Meet-the-People’ tour and distribution of letters of appointment to teachers, embarked on the violence to embarrass the governor and take the shine off the ‘successful tour’.

“Why was it that this happened on the last day of the tour? Why did they choose the governor’s local government to inflict the mayhem”, the party asked?

Restating that the party had eliminated violence in the state in the last three and half years and abhors thuggery and violence, the APC said its party-led government would not leave any stone unturned in bringing the perpetrators to justice."

At least one person was on Saturday reported killed at Aruogba community clash in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State, over the leadership of the community.

It was gathered that trouble started when one of the factional leaders in the community, was said to have recruited thugs from neighbouring communities to unleash mayhem on the community.

A source, told our correspondent under condition of anonymity that there was heavy shooting in the fracas which left five houses and several cars completely razed by the warring factions, while many of the residents scampered for safety.

Shop in the area were also said to have shut down while many youths in the community fled the scene to avoid police arrest.

Efforts to reach the Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Noble Uwoh, proved abortive as he said that he was yet to be briefed on the incident.

It was, however, learnt that the scene of the conflict had been condoned off by men of the Nigeria Police."

However, many mercenaries were, on Friday night, apprehended by police at Shinge community in Lafia Local Government, while strategising on how to carry out another attack in neighbouring communities.

The latest development, according to Sunday Tribune findings, has caused apprehension, as women and children residing at Akgyagu, as well as Agye-Shumutu and Wunge communities in Doma Local Government have deserted the areas for fear of being attacked by the marauders.

Sunday Tribune reliably gathered that the mercenaries, who besieged Kadarko at around 5:30 a.m, started shooting at sight and setting houses ablaze.

When contacted on phone in Lafia, the state capital, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ugochukwu Theodore, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), confirmed the Kadarko attack, but added that the casualties figure was still sketchy as at press time.

He explained that the situation was under control, as fierce-looking mobile and conventional police have been deployed to all troubled communities with a view to forestalling further break down of law and order in the state.

On mercenaries arrested at Shinge, the PPRO said the information was yet to reach his office."

One of the buildings and a car burnt by thugs in Ibadan ... on Sunday.

At least three people were killed and 10 houses destroyed by armed youths who invaded Born Photo, Isale Osi, Idi Arere and Popoyemoja in Ibadan South-West Local Government Area of Oyo State.

The youth who operated freely for about two hours before policemen arrived at the scenes, also burnt or vandalised about 200 shops, several vehicles and a tricycle.

Eyewitnesses said the thugs partly burnt a petrol station at Popoyemoja junction.

Our correspondent gathered that the mayhem started at 9am at Born Photo before it spread to Isale Osi, Idi Arere and Popoyemoja.

Residents linked the violence to last Friday’s attack in which a policeman was shot dead at a rally by the All Progressives Congress.

One of them said, “Youths hired by politicians released several shots at Born Photo junction. This is a fall-out of Friday’s violence at the APC rally. This may not be over soon because there could be reprisal. Government must intervene quickly.”

Mr. Okunola Asimiyu, whose family house on SW9/263 was burnt on Sunday, wondered why his house was a target.

He said, “I am not a politician. My father built this house many decades ago. The fight in Oke-Ado three days ago may have led to today’s (Sunday) attack on our community. I have no friends among the politicians. I was in the building when the thugs set it on fire . I tried to put off the fire but when I realised that it was spreading, I had to escape.”

About five shops in the house were vandalised.

Folake Oladipo, who operated one of the shops, said she lost over N1m.

She added, “I received a call this(Sunday) morning that my shop was burning. I rushed there but I saw people with guns shooting and burning houses. They burnt my refrigerators, generators and looted everything in the shop. I am devastated.”

Also destroyed in the building was a football viewing centre. Its operator, Adepoju Owolabi, said football fans were lucky to have escaped.

At Popoyemoja junction, a BP petrol station was vandalised and partly burnt. Policemen at the scene said calamity would have happened if the fire had reached the fuel dump.

However, the Caretaker Chairman of Ibadan South-West Council Area, Taoreed Adeleke, blamed the opposition for the attack.

Adeleke said, “Clearly, this is the work of the opposition. They want to scare people during elections and place the blame on the government of the day. We appeal that people should return to their homes. People are not ready to talk; they are scared of mentioning the perpetrators for fear of being attacked.

“I will also blame hoodlums or area boys that are bent on disrupting the peaceful atmosphere in the state for the attack. We heard that the people would come up before the election to make the state ungovernable.

“It started on Friday in Oke Ado and its spreading now. I was called early this (Sunday) morning that the problem had started again so I mobilised security men to stop them.”

However, an Accord Party chieftain, Lanre Ogundipe, said the fight was between APC members.

“APC started it among rival groups within the party on Friday. They should not point accusing fingers at any other political party,” he said.

The APC Chairman in the state, Akin Oke, in a statement after the violence, called on the police to investigate the attack thoroughly.

Like Adeleke, Oke blamed the mayhem on the opposition.

His statement read in part, “All evidences at APC disposal pointed at a high-level gang-up by some politicians currently at large to embarrass government and to destroy the three and half years of peace in the state.

“We still insist that the persons behind that violence were carrying out a high-level assignment which has to do with the 2015 elections. The violence betrays logic. Why would APC ‘thugs’, if the allegation of the opposition is to be believed, be involved in shooting the police and not their rival groups? Why did the fomenters of the violence choose the governor’s local government and the last day of his meet-the-people tour, as their target?”

The Police Public Relations Officer, Oyo State Police Command, Olabisi Ilobanefor, said the police had yet to make any arrest.

He said the state Commissioner of Police, Kola Sodipo, would address the media over the spate of attacks in the state on Monday (today).

Sources said the robbers first launched an attack on a nearby police station, killing two policemen in the process, before attacking the bank. The sources added that the attack on the bank, after its closure to customers, left two customers at the ATM dead.

The two victims, reports said, included a female corps member and an unidentified man.

Sources doubted the success of the bandits’ operation in the bank as they hurriedly scampered for safety, shooting indiscriminately into various directions perhaps on getting a hint of the approach of a detachment of troops that arrived the scene shortly. They were said to have escaped through the Ikere- Akure Road.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Victor Babayemi, when contacted, could not give details of the incident, saying the command was still expecting report from the police team that went to the scene.

Last year, the bank was attacked by gunmen who carted away undisclosed amount of money in an operation that threw the ancient city into pandemonium.

In a related development, the Ondo State police command yesterday said it had arrested about seven people over last Thursday’s attack on a bullion van in Elemoso village, along Akure-Ondo expressway.

The Police Public Relation Officer, Wole Ogodo, who disclosed this yesterday while speaking with our correspondent on telephone, said the suspects have been helping the command in its investigation.

According to Ogodo, four of the suspects are policemen from the command while the drivers of the bullion van and the cash officer were not left out in the investigation.

Ogodo said: “Four of our men that escorted the bullion, the cash officer and the two drivers of the escorted van are already with us to help in the ongoing investigation.

“We will do everything possible to get to the root of the matter. Already, the OC SARS (Officer-incharge of the state Anti Robbery Squad) has gone to Bolorunduro where the incident happened as part of the ongoing investigation.”

The PPRO, who noted that the arrested officers had been found wanting in the discharge of their duties, explained that the officers were on illegal duty by not formally booking their movement."

Suspected Boko Haram gunmen have killed at least 20 people in an attack on two villages on the outskirts of Chibok, the town where more than 200 schoolgirls were abducted in April, said a civil defence officer.

The attackers struck Kamtahi and Galtimari villages Monday evening, burning houses and forcing residents to flee, Muhammed Abbas Gava, spokesman of a Nigerian civilian militia, told the Associated Press.

“Virtually every house in the two villages were burnt to ash,” said Gava.

“The villages were totally razed down as residents fled for their lives, some with injuries.”

When contacted, the Borno State police command spokesman, Gideon Jubrin, said he was not aware of the incident.

This is part of a string of attacks in the state, including two suicide bombings on Tuesday at a crowded marketplace.

A medical doctor in Maiduguri, Dr. Musa Taji, said at least 70 people were killed.

On Monday, suspected Boko Haram fighters attacked the village of Damasak, driving into the town with improvised explosive devices and petrol bombs.

Last week, at least 50 people, mostly fishermen were killed in Doron Baga, along the shores of Lake Chad.

“Boko Haram has carried out a series of bombing campaigns since gunmen stole eight trucks of explosive materials from a cement factory in Gombe earlier this month,” said Human Rights Watch researcher, Mausi Segun.

Borno State has been hit the hardest by Boko Haram’s five-year-old Islamic uprising. Nigerian lawmakers are considering extending emergency rule in northeastern Nigeria, which has been in place since May 2013.

More than 1,500 people have been killed by the Boko Haram insurgency this year, according toAmnesty International.

National Mirror learnt that the hoodlums stormed the areas in the early hours of yesterday and were dis­persed around 4a.m when members of the state secu­rity outfit, Operation Burst arrived the scene.

It will be recalled that on Friday and Sunday, an unspecified number of hoodlums unleashed terror on the city, as they attacked and killed one policeman and injuring several others during a rally to welcome Governor Abiola Ajimobi who was on meet-the-peo­ple-tour of the 33 local gov­ernment areas of the state.

However, residents of Ayeye and Opoyosa areas of Ibadan, again, woke up yes­terday morning to shock­ing discovery, with some of their shops broken into and looted by the hoodlums.

Though no lives was lost during yesterday incident, but shop owners recounted their ordeals as others were said to have broken down in tears.

It was gathered that while about 13 shops were smashed and looted, ma­jor roads linking the areas were littered with broken bottles and sharp objects to prevent vehicles from ac­cessing the areas.

Residents who spoke on the attack by the hoodlums, complained of frightening sounds of gunshots, which they said caused fears and anxieties among the people.

One of the traders at Ay­eye market, who identified himself as Baba Folake who deals in assorted drinks de­scribed the incident as very disturbing and painful.

The Caretaker Chair­man of Ibadan North West Local Government, Mr. Wasiu Olatunbosun while speaking on the incident, condemned the attack on the people, which he blamed on the opposition party.

He specifically fingered one Alao Sarafa Adeleye, a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,Youth Leader in the council.

“What happened yester­day was purely politically motivated crisis,and it put paid to the alarm that has been raised for the past three months that as from October, the opposition has planned to start caus­ing problem in some se­lected local governments in Ibadan in other to rubbish the peaceful atmosphere in the state which happened to be one of the cardinal achievement of Senator Ajimobi .

“It was the handiwork of the opposition in the state. The attack was led by one Alao Sarafa Adeleye who happens to be the PDP Youth Leader in the local government and people saw him when he led these thugs to unleash terror on the people.

The Police in Edo State have shot dead two suspected armed robbers and kidnappers along the Benin-Auchi Bypass, in Uhunmwode Local Government Area of the state.

According to the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Noble Uwoh, the two suspects were among a group of “daredevil” hoodlums intercepted by a team of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the command while on a routine patrol of the area.

Uwoh explained that the group of bandits, who had been terrorising commuters along the expressway, opened fire on the vehicle of the security operatives, which led to a gun duel with the police officers.

According to him, the suspected armed robbers died on their way to hospital for treatment as a result of fatal injuries sustained during the exchange of gunfire.

He also said the command recovered some arms and ammunition which include one AK47 rifle and 83 rounds of live ammunition, one pump action gun, 97 live cartridges and 10 expended cartridges.

Others are three AK47 rifle magazines, one face mask, one marine rope, suspected to be used for tying kidnap victims, and six mobile phones.

While assuring the general public that the command would not relent in its effort to maintain peace in the state, the police spokesperson, however, stated that efforts were being made to track down other members of the gang, who fled into the bush with possible bullet wounds.

“The command wishes to enjoin members of the public, especially owners of clinics and hospitals to report anyone found with bullet wounds to the nearest police station,” Uwoh added."

Gunmen suspected to be cultists stormed Omoku in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State on Friday night, killing seven persons.

It was gathered that a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in the area, Godspower Ayodu, was among those who lost their lives during the raid.

Though the reason for the killings could not be immediately ascertained, it was gathered that the assailants operated freely for some time before the intervention of security operatives.

Speaking on the incident, the Chairman of Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area, Mr. Austin Ahiamadu, said on Saturday the gunmen moved from house to house to unleash mayhem.

Ahiamadu, who confirmed that seven people died in the attack, urged the people of the area to be calm, assuring that security operatives had begun patrolling the place to forestall recurrence of the incident.

“Unknown gunmen invaded Omoku and started by killing an elder of the APC and few other people. The figure I cannot immediately say because of the security situation, but it is more than five.

“I appeal to the people of Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni to remain calm as security agents have been patrolling the area,” the council chairman added.

Speaking on the development, the State Police Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, explained that it was a clash between two rival cult groups.

“It was a suspected clash of rival cult groups. Investigation has commenced. People with information of any person with bullet wounds can assist the police in this regard,” Mohammad added.

No fewer than five persons were feared killed while properties estimated at millions of naira were destroyed when Fulani herdsmen allegedly attacked Abugi community in Lokoja Local Government Area of Kogi State.

Our correspondent gathered on Sunday that the incident which took place on Friday evening was a reprisal.

A source, who pleaded anonymity for fear of attack, told journalists in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, on Sunday that the problem between the herdsmen and members of the Abugi community started few days ago when some of the herdsmen allegedly robbed and killed one Alhaji Abdullahi Zakari, who was sent to deliver money to an unnamed person in a neighbouring community.

The source said angered by the killing of Zakari, youths in Abugi engaged in a reprisal in one of the Fulani settlements in the area, which allegedly led to the death of one person in the settlement.

It was further learnt some Fulani elders later met with the paramount ruler of the community, Alhaji Kabir Isa for an amicable resolution of the crisis."

Anyiam-Osigwe

| credits: File copy

Suspected armed robbers have killed a Lagos-based businessman, Mr. Michael Anyiam-Osigwe.

The late Michael was until his death, the Co-ordinator General of the Osigwe Anyiam-Osigwe Foundation and a member of its Board of Trustees.

His father, Emmanuel, was reputed to be one of the first Nigerian investors in the oil sector, while his sister, Peace, started the annual Africa Movie Academy Awards.

The victim was said to be on his way to an engagement in Nkwerre, his home town in Imo State on Saturday, when suspected armed robbers attacked his car on the Ore-Benin Road.

The PUNCH gathered that he was shot in the chest during the attack.

Our correspondent learnt that he was rushed to the EKO Hospital in Ikeja, Lagos, where he began receiving treatment for gunshot injuries.

However, he was said to have given up the ghost on Sunday evening, after the doctors at the hospital tried in vain to save his life.

A statement by one of his six brothers, Charles, a copy of which was obtained by our correspondent, confirmed the incident.

It read in part, “With grief and deep sense of sorrow, but with total submission to the will of the Almighty God who gives and recalls, the Anyiam-Osigwe family announces the untimely passing to eternal glory of Nze Michael Anyiam-Osigwe.

“Michael was killed by armed robbers who operated on the Ore-Benin Road, near the Okada Junction, in the afternoon of 29th November 2014 at about 2.30pm.”

The statement added that Michael was survived by his mother, Chief Dorothy, his wife, Okiemute, five children, six brothers and a sister, among others.

Gunmen on Sunday shot and killed a policeman and one other person in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.

The incident, which happened on Sunday at about 7.45am, took place at Amadi-Ama Town, causing pandemonium around the area as passers-by scampered for safety.

Four armed men, according to an eyewitness, stormed the area and shot at a policeman and a youth suspect to be a member of a cult group.

The youth, who was in a pool of his blood after he was hit by the armed gang, was later identified as Gift, alleged to be a member of Greenlander.

It was learnt that while Gift died on the spot, the policeman was said to have died after being rushed to a nearby hospital within the state capital.

The police, however, embarked on mass arrest within the area, where the incident took place following the killing of their colleagues.

The wife of one of those arrested by the police, Mrs. Seline Koko, disclosed that security operatives took away her husband while he was ironing his clothes.

Pleading with the police to release her husband, Mrs. Koko maintained that her husband knew nothing about the incident at Amadi Town.

“I am appealing that the police should release my husband because he does not know anything about what happened. He was ironing some clothes when the police came and arrested him. I have gone to some police stations around the place, but my husband is not there,” she said.

The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, who confirmed the incident, disclosed that 25 persons were arrested in connection with the killing of a policeman and a suspected cultist."

An eyewitness and a native of the area, Alhaji Jafaru Arzika Jega, told Daily Sun that as a result of the exchange of gunfire by the police and the angry natives, five people died and 24 sustained injuries.

Arzika Jega added that the injured persons had been taken to Maiyama and Sir Yahaya Memorial hospitals for medical attention, while the five corpses had since been buried.

He also revealed that the natives were also protesting the action of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the local government area, Aliyu Yusuf.

Injured OAU students

| credits: Sodiq Oyeleke

No fewer than six students were injured during a clash among some students of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, on Sunday evening.

While some of the eyewitnesses described the fight as a power tussle between students who were loyal to the President of the Student Union, Ibikunle Isaac, and those of the Vice-President, Oladejo Olufunmi, others described it as a cult attack.

They all, however, agreed that the clash was an aftermath of President Goodluck Jonathan’s visit to the institution.

It was learnt that the Education Rights Campaign members had just concluded a meeting at the Students’ Union Building when the fight broke out.

Among those involved in the fight were some union executive members, suspended students of the university, members of the Security Committee of the SU and ERC members.

Some of the students, who suffered varying degrees of injuries, were rushed to nearby hospitals for treatment.

One of them, Tedy, was allegedly stabbed with a pointed object suspected to be a screw driver, while another student, David, was dealt a matchete cut on his head.

It was gathered that the door to the SU President Office, where some students hid, was broken while the occupants were thoroughly beaten.

There are, however, two sides to the cause of the fight.

While some of the students said it was as a result of ideological differences, others inferred that it was related to the protest held during Jonathan’s visit.

Jonathan, traditional rulers and some politicians were at the OAU for a conference, where Jonathan was endorsed ahead of the 2015 polls.

The campus fracas took a dangerous dimension when students of the school engaged one another at the school gate with weapons.

Chief Security Officer of the university, Mr. Paul Ogidi, said there was no cult attack in the institution.

“It is true that our students fought. There was no cult attack on our campus. We did not witness any attack, but a fight among our students,” he said.

But the Vice-President of the Students Union, Funmi Oladejo, insisted that what happened on the campus could be likened to 1999 cult attack that claimed the lives of students.

She denied the fight as being factional, but hinted that the controversy that surrounded the presence of Jonathan on the university campus last Friday contributed to the cause of the fight.

She said, “I was to have a meeting at the SUB yesterday (Sunday) around 6pm. On getting there, I met a student, Sanyaolu Oluwajuwon, inside the gutter, where he had been seriously beaten and I wondered what happened. After a while, the injured students went to show the injury to others and that enraged many students.

“Meanwhile, what started the fight, I heard, was that ERC were having their meeting when the President and the PRO passed through the place and saw them. He then called his boys to come, saying some people were having an opposition meeting at the SUB.

“After beating them up, they ran away except Teddy that waited. We later realised that those that ran to town went to hire cult members, who came with machetes. We eventually caught four of them. Two were students and two were non-students.”

When asked if the fight was connected to Jonathan’s visit, she responded, “As far as I am concerned, that is to mess up the whole issue. They want to make it a partisan stuff and that is out of sense. Our unionism is known to be independent and non-partisan. So, the case of Jonathan’s visit was sardonic. They (Ibikunle’s faction) wanted to pay back the opposition that greeted Jonathan’s visit.”

It was learnt that the two of the arrested people involved in the fight were taken by students to the Awolowo Hall of the university, while the security officials took another two students involved in the fight.

The President of the SU, Isaac Ibikunle, told our correspondent that none of his loyalists were cult members.

He promised to call back to give his “full reaction” after a meeting expected to be held between members of the executive and the parliament on Monday

The Public Relations Officer of the union, Oludare Bamidele, said, “It remains a sardonic issue that suspended students are beating legitimate students on OAU campus right now. Is this intellectual struggle? The act of dragging a security official to be beaten is an affront to law and arrival of the hobbesian state of nature.”

Osun State Police Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Sade Odoro, said those involved in the fight were not cultists.

She said, “OAU students truly fought and they were taken to the police station. The police counselled and released them after a while.”

Public Relations Officer of OAU, Mr. Biodun Olarewaju, confirmed that the students fought over Jonathan’s visit to the institution.

He said, “There was no cult invasion in OAU. Our campus is too fortified for that to occur. Our security go on regular patrol and we are in collaboration with external security forces.

“What happened was just a fight between two groups of students.

“Some believe that it was wrong for another to take picture and welcome the President, Jonathan, while others believe is not, especially when it is done without their consent.

“It is just a friendly fight. All that happened was that a group felt they were not carried along.”

2491,"Gunmen attack Ekiti prison, kill warden, 20 dogs",11/30/2014,,Ado Ekiti,Ekiti,1,,,,Other Armed Actor,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,Bomb,Gun,,,Other,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/gunmen-attack-ekiti-prison-kill-warder-20-dogs/,,,7.632319927,5.217870235,"Ado Ekiti, Ekiti, Nigeria",Nigeria,": Kamarudeen Ogundele

Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose

At least one prison official was feared killed with over 20 sniffer dogs dead on Sunday night when some gunmen stormed the Federal Prison, on Afao-Ekiti road in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State.

The Comptroller of Prison, Mr. Kehinde Fadipe, who confirmed the attack, said the gunmen were not Boko Haram members.

Sources said the gunmen numbering about 60 stormed the prison in Hilux trucks with dangerous weapons, including cudgels, cutlasses, AK 47 rifles and charms.

Another source said the attackers were chanting ‘Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar’ (God is the greatest) during the attack on the prison, where some inmates were set free.

It was learnt that as soon as the gunmen arrived the prison, they detonated a bomb after which they engaged in sporadic shootings that lasted for more than 30 minutes.

There were also insinuations that the attack was staged to set free a murder suspect, Mr. Adeniyi Adedipe, who is facing criminal charges over the murder of a former state chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Chief Omolafe Aderiye.

Adedipe was a former coordinator of the Oodua Peoples Congress in the state.

As of the time of filing the report, journalists were not allowed into the premises of the prison.

There were blood stains on the road leading to the prison.

Another source said a top official of the state Prisons Command, who was rushing to the scene to see what was happening, was shot dead.

As journalists were waiting for briefing, one of the prisoners that escaped walked in, saying he ran out when he heard sporadic shooting at night but had to come back.

Fadipe, who confirmed the attack to journalists on Monday, denied that any life was lost during the attack.

He said he was not aware of the shooting of any of the officials of the state command.

He said, “We are moving around to assess the situation. It was not a jail-break but an attack on the prison. The main entrance of the prison was broken.

“What happened is that we were attacked from outside not from within. They came with different weapons. They attacked our men on duty and we have been here since 10.30pm yesterday (Sunday).”

The comptroller said his men were already out to re-arrest inmates that escaped during the attack, although he did not give figures.

He however dispelled the insinuation that the Boko Haram insurgents were responsible for the attack.

He wondered how the group could have attacked the Prisons when none of its members was in the prison custody.

Fadipe also faulted the thinking that members of the OPC might have been responsible for the attack.

He confirmed that Adedipe, a.k.a ‘Apase’, was still in their custody.

As of the time of filing this report, fully armed security men have intensified surveillance around the prison and all adjourning roads.

Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress has called on the police in the state to build a strong security around the prison, saying the Peoples Democratic Party may be planning to attack the facility with a view to killing the suspect and other inmates.

The Publicity Secretary of the party, Chief Taiwo Olatubosun, who spoke on the telephone with journalists, denied any link with the attack. He described it as another ploy by the PDP to tarnish the image of the APC in Ekiti State.

He said, “What shall we gain for doing that, we cannot do such a thing. It is not in our character to do such things.

“Very soon, the PDP and the governor will have to accuse God for running a clueless government and for their shortcoming.”

Olatubosun said the government was talking from the “figment of its imagination”, asking “is it the APC that is in charge of the prison or the security of the state? It is the figment of their imagination that the APC is connected with the breaking of the prison. We don’t know anything about it.”

2496,One dies as police tackle robbers in Calabar,12/2/2014,,Calabar Municipal,Cross River,1,,State Actor,,,,Robber,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,Gun,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/one-dies-as-police-tackle-robbers-in-calabar/,,,4.976709843,8.336429596,"Calabar Municipal, Cross River, Nigeria",Nigeria,"by Mudiaga Affe, Calabar

An unidentified suspected armed robber was at the wee hours of Tuesday gunned down by officers and men of the Cross River State Police Command who acted on distress call from residents of Efangha Close in the Eight Miles axis of the Calabar metropolis.

The armed robber met his waterloo during a gun duel with the police while trying to escape with four others on a Ford pickup van that was stolen from one of their victims. The four other robbers were said to have escaped.

Items recovered included six mobile phones, two locally made pistols with cartridges, four laptops, one i-pad, accessories, iron cutter, a Ford Pick Up van belonging to the Cross River State Internal Revenue Service with registration number CR 30 RB and N50, 000.

Narrating the incident to PUNCH Metro at the state Police headquarters in Calabar, one of the affected victims, (name withheld), said the robbers broke into his apartment with sophisticated equipment and guns at about 3.45am and made away with valuables, cash and his official vehicle.

He said, “At about 3.45am, some two young men forcefully found their way to my bedroom with guns and were requesting for money. I told them I have not been paid salary as a civil servant. While that was going on, they ransacked my room and took four phones that they laid their hands on, money belonging to my wife, laptops and my official vehicle.

“They spent about 10 minutes and left. It was after then I discovered they left behind one of my phones which they did not see. It was that phone I used in contacting the police, who responded immediately.”

Another victim around the same vicinity, who would not want his name mentioned, said the robbers gained entrance into his apartment after serious battle at bringing down his door, adding that it was delay in gaining entrance that gave him the opportunity of making a distress call to the police.

Giving analysis of the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Hogan Bassey, said the police acted promptly when they received the distress call at about 3.45am.

Bassey said it was on the strength of the call that officers and men from the Federal Housing Police Division swung into action, adding that one of the suspected robbers was gunned down while trying to escape with pick up van while others escaped.

While noting that the police was still on the trail of the escapees, Bassey said the police had put in place proactive measures to stem upsurge in crime now that the festive season is approaching.

Meanwhile, the Officer in Charge of the state Criminal Investigation Department, Alhaji Abdusalam Ganiyu, has enjoined members of the public to strive to make calls to the police when in distress.

He promised that the police was now better equipped to respond to distress calls from victims of robbery attacks or other criminal activities."

Scene of the clash

| credits: Samson Folarin

Like a war scene, continuous gun report tore through the air in the Ebute Meta area of Lagos State on Tuesday afternoon.

As residents ran helter-skelter in the ensuing confusion, four youths were shot dead, while several others were wounded, as 20 vehicles were also vandalised on four streets, namely Kano, Ondo, Odunfa and Ibadan.

Our correspondent gathered that the crisis was the aftermath of a primary election conducted for two candidates of the All Progressives Congress ─ Oladele Adekanye (Lado) and Bashiru Oloto.

The two men were aspiring to get the APC ticket to represent the Lagos Mainland Constituency one in the 2015 elections.

Our correspondent learnt that the primary was won by Lado, a former council chairman.

PUNCH Metro gathered that immediately the results were announced, more than 100 hoodlums from Apapa Road, who wielded guns, among other weapons, trooped into the streets to create mayhem.

Our correspondent counted four damaged vehicles on Kano Street, three on Ibadan Street, seven on Odunfa Street and six on Ondo Street.

Those who were shot and cut with machetes were said to have been evacuated.

A resident, who pleaded anonymity, said one person was shot on Simpson Street, two died on Lagos Street, while one was killed on Ibadan Street.

He said, “The boys are from Apapa Road. They cannot be less than 100 because they were many and had double-barreled guns, cutlasses and others. They shot sporadically into the air and attacked people.

“Apart from the four persons that were shot dead, many more were seriously injured and were rushed to hospitals.”

A trader on Kano Street, Tolulope Salaam, said the gang carted away all her wares which she estimated at N60, 000.

At the Kano junction, handsets and other products on display were reportedly carted away by the rampaging hoodlums.

When our correspondent visited Ibadan Street, where the primary election took place, he observed that the road was deserted.

A mechanic in the area, Musbau Agbogun, wondered how the security agencies could not repel the attack.

He said, “I have been seeing them patrolling the area. I also saw men of the Department of State Service and policemen from Denton division moving round. Despite that, innocent lives were wasted. If this can happen in the party primaries, what should we expect in the real election?”

A victim, Gideon Makinde, whose Toyota Camry was vandalised told PUNCH Metro that he parked his car by a side of the road.

A resident, Abdulhamed Kareem, explained that some of the hoodlums broke into his sister’s supermarket, and took all the money in the drawer.

He showed our correspondent a commercial bus that was riddled with bullets.

He said, “The man inside the bus was hit by a bullet and has been rushed to a hospital,” he added.

It was learnt that the same scenario almost played out during another APC primaries in the Ogudu area, but for the intervention of the police.

It was learnt that protesters in Ogudu were prevented from fomenting trouble during the primary.

The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Kenneth Nwosu, said nobody died in the Ebute Meta incident.

He said, “There was a congress in the place this afternoon. When they finished and announced the result, some persons attempted to cause commotion.

“We were able to protect the materials and the officials, who were escorted out of the scene without any harm. One person was shot and he was taken to the hospital. There is no record of death.”

He added that the election in the Ogudu area was peaceful and there was no shooting.

He said, “Election was held around a police station in Ogudu, and some people came from Oworonshoki and started chanting protest songs. They were asked to leave.”

The APC spokesperson for Lagos State, Joe Igbokwe, told PUNCH Metro he was not aware of any mayhem.

At least, nine persons were feared dead and scores injured as gunmen, suspected to be Fulani insurgents, on Tuesday evening launched an attack on Ashige community of Lafia East Development Area of Nasarawa State.

The incident, according to eyewitness’ account, occurred at 5pm when the AK 47-wielding Fulani gunmen attacked farmers who were returning home after laying ambush for them around River Ashangwa.

Speaking to our correspondent in Lafia, one of those who conveyed the corpses of their kinsmen to the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital, Lafia, Mr. Gimba Audu, explained that his younger brother was one of those attacked by the gunmen.

He said he was currently receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in Lafia, after sustaining a gunshot injury on the head during the attack.

Also speaking, one of the survivors, Mr. Michael Danladi, said,”Fulani men attacked us on our way back from the farm at about 5pm, shooting at us sporadically. They killed nine instantly.”

According to him, nine other people sustained varying degrees of injury and have been taken to private hospitals in Lafia and Ashige for treatment. He added that five persons were still unaccounted for.

He said that the invasion took place four kilometres from Ashige town. He therefore called on Governor Tanko Al-Makura to provide security in the area, particularly as it presently played host to internally displaced persons from Alawagana, Assakio and other adjoining villages ravaged by the recent attacks in the state.

The councillor representing Ashige/Ugah Ward in the Lafia Local Government Area, Juliana Dauda, who hails from the area, told our correspondent that she was alerted to the unfortunate incident on Wednesday morning and upon visiting DASH, counted nine dead bodies.

She said, “After I was informed this morning, I went to the specialist hospital and counted nine dead bodies. As I am talking to you, the matter has been reported to the Police who told us they are on top of the situation.”

Confirming the incident to our correspondent in Lafia, the Police Public Relations Officer, Nasarawa State Command, DSP Ugochukwu Theodore, stated that the information regarding the incident was still sketchy as of the time of filing this report.

He assured the people that the police would find out the cause of the incident.

Gunmen on Wednesday shot dead the nephew of Peoples Democratic Party senatorial aspirant, Mr. Ehiogie West-Idahosa, and an orderly at Akhionbare located in the Government Reservation Area, Benin, Edo State.

It was learnt that the assailants, suspected to be armed robbers, shot the two men, who were in a black Ford vehicle on the convoy of the aspirant, at about 1pm.

Mr. West-Idahosa, who was a three-time member of the Federal House of Representative, was however taken away unhurt under the protection of his other orderlies and aides, as an exchange of gunfire ensued.

Although the identity of the aspirant’s relative could not be ascertained of the time of filing this report, it was gathered that he was the only son of his mother.

An unconfirmed source told our correspondent that the suspected armed robbers opened fire on the vehicle with number plate BF 866 JJJ, which was said to have conveyed the deceased from one of the new generation banks in the state capital.

Residents in the neighbourhood, some of whom ran for cover, were also thrown into confusion, at the sound of gunshots.

It was further learnt that an undisclosed sum of money was allegedly carted away by the gunmen during the incident, while the vehicle, which was said to have been riddled with bullets and had blood stains, was removed from the scene by the security agency.

The Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Noble Uwoh, who confirmed the incident, identified the late police officer as Sergeant Usifoh David, attached to the Special Protection Unit.

Uwoh, however, said that the command would do its best to apprehend the attackers.

“The person’s name is Sergeant Usifoh David, attached to Special Protection Unit and one other civilian; a brother to the aspirant.

“It happened at Akhionbare, Off Giwamu.

“We will do our best and we can assure that we will get them in no time. They cannot escape.

Two persons were said to have died on Monday in a land dispute between rival parties from Lalupon and Erunmu, Ibadan, Oyo State.

Eyewitnesses said armed youths from both communities, which are situated on the outskirt of Ibadan, clashed over parcels of land situated along the border lines separating the two communities on Friday.

The fight continued until Monday, leaving two persons dead and several persons injured.

A source said, “A man of Lalupon origin was attacked by youths on Friday evening when he went to bury something that was suspected to be charms on the disputed land. From what I know, the two communities agreed sometimes to stay away from the land after years of disputes over its ownership.

“There was reprisal by the supporters of the man that was attacked and violence spread in both communities.

“Jamiu Akanji and Wasiu Adeyemi were killed in the attack while many people were wounded.”

The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo State, Adekunle Ajisebutu, confirmed the attacks and the number of deaths.

He added that Adeyemi was buried before the police could reach the embattled areas.

He said the quick response of the police prevented the crisis from escalating to other communities.

Ajisebutu explained that Akanji was killed around 4.30am at Erunmu while Adeyemi, who also hailed from Erunmu, was allegedly killed at about 2.30pm on Sunday.

No arrest had yet been made by the police but the PPRO said the leaders of both communities had held a meeting with the command, stressing that peace had returned to the areas."

No fewer than five persons have been killed and several villages destroyed in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State during a renewed attack by suspected Fulani militia.

Also, two persons died on Monday in a land dispute between rival communities of Lalupon and Erunmu towns in Oyo State.

Investigation by one of our correspondents showed that as of Monday, hundreds of Agatu farmers were displaced from their homes, just as schools and churches were closed to avert further destruction of lives and properties.

The member representing Agatu State Constituency in the state House of Assembly, Alhaji Sule Audu, told newsmen that the heinous attack occurred on Sunday.

Audu said his people were preparing to go to church when the insurgents attacked them.

He maintained that several houses in various communities including the Adeka and Olegadeje villages were destroyed.

The lawmaker added that farmlands and properties were also damaged in the renewed attack.

He, however, appealed to people of the area to remain calm as efforts were on to provide succour for victims and also to fish out the perpetrators. The lawmaker urged the state government to provide relief materials for the displaced persons.

Efforts to speak with the Benue State Police Commissioner Mr. Hyacinth Dagala, proved abortive as he did not pick calls and text messages put across to him by one of our correspondents.

In the Oyo State attack, eyewitnesses said that armed youths from Lalupon and Erunmu communities situated on the outskirts of Ibadan clashed over a parcel of land in the border separating the communities on Friday.

The fight, which continued until Monday, left two people dead and several others injured.

The source said, “A man of Lalupon origin was attacked by youths on Friday evening when he went to plant something that was suspected to be charms on the disputed land. From what I know, the two communities agreed sometimes ago to stay away from the land after years of dispute over its ownership. There was a reprisal by the supporters of the man that was attacked and violence spread in both communities.

“Jamiu Akanji and Wasiu Adeyemi were killed in the attack while many people were injured,” the source added.

on Monday clashed against their colleagues at Ansar-U-Deen Secondary School, Iludun. No fewer than 10 pupils were injured as students of St . James Anglican School, in the Kola Balogun area of Osogbo, Osun State,clashed against their colleagues at Ansar-U-Deen Secondary School, Iludun.

Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that most of the students engaged in the clash belonged to rival cult groups.

Residents of the area said the students had clashed on Friday and a student almost lost his arm in the fight.

It was gathered that students, who were injured during the Monday clash, were rushed to a hospital where they were treated.

There were conflicting reports on the cause of the Monday clash.

Some said it was a fight over a girl while other said it was a reprisal by a group whose member was injured on Friday .

A female student said, “Just as we were about settling down in school this morning, friends of the student of Saint James’ student, who was injured during last week fight, stormed our school and started using matchete and charms on us.

“Some students were injured. We learnt that it was a reprisal, one student, who was said to be a cult guy, was said to have been beaten by members of a rival group and others came on a revenge mission.”

The Police Public Relations Officer in Osun State, Mrs. Folasade Odoro, did not pick calls put across to her telephone while the text message sent to her telephone set was not responded to.

However, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in the state, Mr. Ayo Olowe, confirmed the incident to our correspondent on the telephone.

He said three students were injured while some of the students were arrested by the police."

National Mirror reliably gathered that the fracas occurred between youths of Ekuigbo and Otor-Iwhreko communities over who should control the Ughelli Main market sited in the area.

Eyewitnesses told our correspondent that no fewer than three corpses were counted while the fight lasted before officers and men of the 222 Battalion and the Ughelli Area Command of the Delta State command intervened to halt the fracas escalating to other parts of town.

Ughelli is the hometown of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Dr Steve Oru.

Although details of the incident were hazy at press time, traders at the market told newsmen that the two youth groups used very dangerous weapons freely, which raised the number of casualties.

They recounted that, aside hunting for rival youths with guns and dangerous weapons, some traders and customers were also severely injured in the clash that lasted over an hour.

Chairman of Otor Iwhereko community, Mr. Felix Okoro, however confirmed the incident, saying over 12 youths from his community sustained life-threatening gunshot wounds but were in stable condition. Okoro could not clarify the total number of youths from his community who lost their lives in the row.

He added that though some of the youths from his community collapsed while the gun fight was on, they were rushed to hospital for medical attention.

The Police Public Relations Officer of the state command, DSP Celestina Kalu, confirmed the incident when contacted. She explained that no life was lost in the clash, admitting that 12 persons sustained severe injuries."

Gunmen have kidnapped the wife of Chairman, Osun State University chapter of Academic Staff Union of Universities, Mrs. Funmilayo Abiona.

Abiona was abducted in Osogbo on Friday night.

Our correspondent gathered on Saturday that Mrs. Abiona closed from her shop around Oke Bale area of Osogbo and was heading home to meet her husband, Dr. Oluseye Abiona, when the hoodlums who had been on her trail caught up with her and forcefully took her away after they had engaged her in hot argument.

The hoodlums, according to some residents of the area were dressed in red shirts and this made some to believe that the abductors might be members of a cult group from the university.

The abducted woman was said to have been driving home an unregistered Lexus car and was in the car with her two children when the incident happened.

After crossing the woman’s car, the hoodlums were said to have come down and uttered some words which angered the woman and she flared up.

Mrs. Abiona was said to have struggled with her captors who eventually overpowered her and forced her into a red car which they used for the operation.

The hoodlums, out of anger, were said to have smashed the rear screen of the Lexus car but they left the car and the children and drove away their target.

Efforts to speak with the ASUU chairman were unsuccessful. However, source close to him said that the case had been reported to the police.

The source said that the case was reported at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Osogbo on Saturday.

Calls put across to the Police Public Relations Officer in Osun State, Mrs. Folasade Odoro, to confirm the abduction terminated abruptly on many occasions due to poor signal but she was yet to respond to the text message sent to her when this report was filed."

The Defence authorities have said a suicide bomber, who rammed a Honda car primed with Improvised Explosive Devices into a military checkpoint in Bajoga, Gombe State, have been shot dead by soldiers.

The Director of Defence Information, Maj. Gen Chris Olukolade, said in an electronic mail on Wednesday that the suicide bomber successfully rammed the bomb-laden Honda car into the military checkpoint but the bombs failed to explode.

Olukolade said the soldiers reacted swiftly by killing the bomber, who was trying to flee the scene of the incident.

He stated that the troops retrieved the IEDs from the car and handed them over to the police.

The statement read, “A suicide bomber who rammed into a military checkpoint in Bajoga, Gombe State yesterday(on Tuesday), failed to achieve his mission.

It was also stated that security agents also raided a hide out of terrorists in Nasarawa Local Government Area of Kano Kano State, where they uncovered a bomb-making factory in the area.

Olukolade said that some bomb-making experts, arrested by the security agents, were already undergoing investigation.

According to him, the security forces were expecting the latest arrests to give some useful clues into the activities of the sect.

The Defence spokesman added that the military authorities had issued a directive to all troops involved in the counter-terrorism operation to sustain the tempo of their operations by ensuring that the insurgents were prevented from attacking civilian targets during the festive period."

Dr. David Akintayo Oguntuase

The family of Dr. David Akintayo Oguntuase, Head of Paediatrics at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, who was found dead on his clinic in Akure, Ondo State, after it was razed by fire in the eve of Christmas, has said the medical practitioner was murdered.

The Universal Medical Clinic owned by Oguntuase was in flames when residents were in festive mood and by the time the bellows of fire and smoke died down, Dr. Oguntuase was found dead.

While the police in Ondo are still examining the different theories to unravelling the cause of the fire, the deceased’s family has concluded that the medical practitioner was killed by assassins and burnt to give a semblance of a fire accident.

The older brother of the deceased, Ben Oguntuase, in a statement made available to our correspondent on Friday, said, a thorough examination of the debris of the hospital and the site of the incident revealed trails left behind by the murderers and how they accomplished the dastardly act.

“They shot him in the main clinic area and carried his body to the room in the back area where they left him face down. Not done, they severed his hands and legs before proceeding to douse the body with petrol.

“The rest of the building on the inside was sprinkled with petrol before it was all set ablaze. It inferno made the building implode as the roof caved in,” the senior Oguntuase said.

He noted that the fire did not affect other surrounding buildings, suggesting that the killing was professionally plotted and executed.

Explaining the premise on which his theory was based, Oguntuase said the walls of the clinic were stained with blood showing that his brother was attacked and dragged to the place where he was eventually burnt.

He also explained that the walls of the fence showed marks of the feet of the assailants as they climbed to escape through the fence, and that the keg with which they brought petrol was left behind at their exit point.

“This case has gone beyond mere speculation into the realm of reality as to where the police should focus their searchlight to unearth the criminals and their sponsor,” he said.

Oguntuase also rejected the theories of suicide or fire accident caused by a gas explosion, saying the doctor’s body was dismembered before it was set ablaze. He added that there was enough evidence at the crime scene to assist the investigation of the police.

He said the family called on the police to investigate the matter.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Wole Ogodo, said although the command had yet to get a full briefing on the development, the family would be required to come up with substantial evidences supporting their position.

“The family will come up with the evidences they have and we can assure you that we will bring the fellow involved to book. Once we get the necessary information, we will not hesitate to do our part,” Ogodo said.

Incidentally, Dr. Alonge and Dr. Oguntuase were on the list of persons accused of threatening the life of the Medical Director of FMC, Dr. Olufemi Omotoso.

Dr. Longe told our correspondent on Tuesday that the attackers broke through his door violently brandishing dangerous weapons and threatened to kill him.

“They actually did not ask for anything. They said they came to kill me. For over 30 minutes I pleaded with them and prayed, and somehow they changed their minds,” the traumatized medical doctor said.

He also narrated that he was hit with a metal and manhandled in the presence of his wife and children.

“I can only say that I escaped with my life through the help of God. They came in about 2.00am. They were two that came in and we suspected that there were others waiting outside,” he said.

Dr. Longe said the matter had been reported at the Okuta Elerinla Police Station in Akure.

By John Dugbe / Special Correspondent, Ughelli

SUSPECTED armed robbers, on New Year eve, went on rampage in Ughelli, Ughelli Local Government Area, killing a retired principal, E. E. Ekee at Ogbojuku street and also shot and injured the publisher of Rainbow Newspaper, Matthias Ogbagah, at Ogodo Street.

Ogbagah, who is also the financial secretary of the Ughelli chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), told journalists on his hospital bed that he walked into the gunmen numbering seven, who were already within his compound before he was shot at close range.

He said: “Immediately I entered the compound, they accosted me and collected my phones and cash in my pocket after which, I was shot by one of them, who was armed and they left me in my pool of blood, thinking I was dead.

“On realising they have gone, I tried to seek for help by hopping and jumping the fence behind the compound only for them to shoot at me on sighting me trying to scale the fence. At this point, I acted like I was dead after which, I was rescued and taking to the hospital by some neighbours.”

It would be recalled that the same journalist, on November 15 2014, sustained various degrees of life threatening cuts when he was attacked by three gunmen, who were later arrested by members of the Ughelli Vigilante Outfit.

While confirming the killing of Ekee, the state Police Public Relations Office (PPRO), Celestina Kalu, said the police was on the trail of the suspected hoodlums and expressed hope that the suspects would be arrested and brought to book.

No fewer than 15 persons were reportedly killed at Ambe-Madaki village in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State by suspected Fulani hersdmen.

The attack, our correspondent learnt, occurred at about 4am on Friday.

A resident of the area, Mr Yohana Adamu, in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said the invaders, who were armed with sophisticated weapons, arrived at the village at about 4am on Friday and started shooting sporadically and setting houses ablaze in the process.

He said scores of residents of the area sustained varying degrees of injuries from gunshots while over 20 houses in the area were razed.



He said, “We are surprised that despite the agreement that our communities had with the Fulanis not to attack each other, they have been attacking us.

“We have not compiled the casualty figure yet because some people are still missing, but we have 15 corpses already.”

The spokesman for the Kaduna State Police Command, DSP Aminu Lawan, could not be reached for comments, but a security source in Sanga, who is not authorised to speak to journalist, confirmed the latest attack.

The Islamic fundamentalist sect, Boko Haram, on Saturday night attacked Babbangida town, the headquarters of Tarmuwa local government area of Yobe state.

Speaking on phone to our correspondent on Sunday morning, a resident of the town Mohammed Hassan said the insurgents came strong on the town at about 6:30pm, engaging security forces in a gun battle.

According to him, the places of battle include the military base located north of the town, the police station at the southern part, as well as the local government secretariat, the Government Lodge and the boarding primary school, ""all of which the terrorists have the intention of destroying,""

He said: ""The security forces from what we have seen so far have been able to repel them, but we are still entertaining fear that the battle may continue today.""

Hassan said the number of casualties still remains unknown as most of the places of heavy battle were still cordoned off by the military.

Saturday's attack makes it four times major Yobe towns have been attacked by the insurgents within the last one month as the sect has lately attacked Damaturu, Damagum and Geidam, all in December.

But the attack on Babbangida is the first in the new year.

Babbangida is 50 kilometres north of Damaturu, the Yobe state capital and has always been attacked by the insurgents."

Shurun is a border village between Barkin Ladi and Mangu Local Government Area of the state.

It was reported that the gunmen stormed the village and started shooting sporadically, which forced villagers to flee to Dorowa, a neighbouring village in the area.

Saturday Independent gathered from eyewitnesses that, ""On hearing the sound of gunshots villagers woke up and started fleeing and our attackers had a field day as the operation lasted till the early hours of this morning.""

According to them, barns and farmlands were destroyed in the attack.

He said, ""It is quite worrisome that the gunmen have been identified as the Fulani herdsmen that are living within our communities. They carry out these deadly attacks and get back to their huts unharmed.

""The heavy arms our attackers use goes to show that there is a coordinated plan to eliminate us.""

The Plateau police public relations officer, Abu Emmanuel, said he was yet to get full details of the attack from the Divisional Police Officer in the locality.

One person might have been killed while many were seriously injured when two groups of armed youths shot at vehicles conveying supporters of the All Progressives Congress from Asari-Toru and Khana Local Government Areas to the inaugural presidential campaign of the APC candidate, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).

The twin attack on the convoys of APC supporters was said to have occurred at the same time at abut 5.30am as the party faithful made their way to the Adokiye Amasiemaka Stadium in the Ikwerre Local Government Area.

It was gathered that though nobody died in Khana Local Government Area after the attack along Bori-Saakpenwa Road, some of those who were attacked by the armed youths, alleged that the thugs were working for the Peoples Democratic Party.

An eyewitness, who spoke with The PUNCH in a telephone interview, accused a former militant leader from the area of being behind the attack on the APC supporters.

The ex-militant leader is from Gokana Local Government Area of the state and a member of the PDP.

A source said five of the victims, who were shot in Khana, were rushed to a hospital in Port Harcourt where some bullets were extracted from their bodies.

The APC Chairman in Ward Six in Khana Local Government Area, Mr. Doole Adoonam, said the APC supporters were travelling in a convoy of three buses when they ran into the ambush of the gunmen.

“Seven people from Ward Six in Khana are lying critically ill from gunshot wounds sustained from an early morning attack along Bori-Saakpenwa Road. Those injured were APC faithful, who were on their way to attend the start of the presidential campaign of Buhari in Port Harcourt.

“On approaching the Mile 30 of Bori-Saakpenwa Road, some gunmen opened fire on two of our buses, injuring some of my party men and women. The attack was too spontaneous for the drivers to beat a retreat,” Adoonam said in a statement made available to our correspondent.

Explaining that it was God that spared the lives of the APC supporters, Adoonam said, “Two of my party faithful; a young lady and a young man, are in very critical situation. As we speak, I pray nothing happens to them.

“We are not deterred by this action by some hired marksmen. Ogonis know who they want and our vote must count this time. We are not new to arms struggle and they (gunmen) cannot intimidate us.

At the rally in Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Governor Rotimi Amaechi accused the PDP of being responsible for the attack on APC supporters in Asari-Toru and Khana.

He condemned the action of shooting party supporters, who were on their way to the Buhari presidential campaign.

He told the crowd at the stadium that members of the PDP believed in guns while their APC counterparts believed in God and man.

State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, said the state police command had begun investigation after it received complaint of attack on a bus conveying some persons to Port Harcourt."

Political thugs on Wednesday wounded eight policemen including a Divisional Police Officer when they attacked a political leader of the All Progressives Congress in Efon-Alaaye, Ekiti State, Chief Joseph Alake.

Alake gave the revelation at the Political Stakeholders Meeting organised by law enforcement agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission in Ado-Ekiti on Thursday.

He revealed that the thugs invaded his house at about 11 a.m and fired several gunshots with sinister intention to kill him and members of his household because he had been the rallying point of the opposition party in Efon Local Government Area.

Alake said the Police had a hectic time arresting the thugs who dared them to shoot them and in the process injured eight police officers including the DPO of Ijero.

“These people came in at about 11 a.m and brandished dangerous weapons.

One of them even inflicted a machete wound on a boy in my house. They fired gunshots and threatened to burn down my house because of my political affiliation. However, the quick intervention of the Area Commander of Ijero and the SARS Commander saved the day.

“The SARS and the Area Commander’s rescued me from the scene and took me to Ijero where I passed the night. I would have been killed but for quick intervention of the police,” he stated.

The Commissioner of Police, Taiwo Lakanu, who confirmed the attack at the forum said he immediately ordered his men to rescue Alake when he got the information.

He commended his men for displaying high level of professionalism in handling the incident, which he described as frightening and barbaric.

He urged political parties to play the game in accordance with the dictate of the constitution and electoral laws.

“Endeavor to tolerate each other in the conduct of your electioneering campaigns and shun all kinds of vulgar/abusive language that can degenerate into violence.

“Let us have from you, timely report of the incidence around you to enable us nip-in-bud any ugly incidence that can mar the conduct of the election.

“Shun all acts of hooliganism in your campaign activities and the idea of moving out on campaign with offensive or destructive weapons because all your campaign would be covered by the police and anybody found wanting in this course would be severely dealt with,” Lakanu vowed."

A group of refugees in Diffa, Niger, after fleeing Boko Haram violence in Nigeria.

VIOLENCE is yet to abate in Yobe State as suspected of Boko Haram terrorists on Wednesday in convoy of Toyota Hilux vehicles and motorcycles attacked Katarko village in Gujba Local Council, killing 25 people. The insurgents also abducted women and children.

News about the development came Thursday as the Federal Government said it was intensifying efforts to recapture Baga from the control of Boko Haram insurgents.

According to a resident that fled to Damaturu yesterday, the terrorists torched several houses and shops before fleeing into the Gujba Forest, north of the attacked village. Katarko is a farming community on the Damaturu-Biu road, and 21 kilometres south of Damaturu, the state capital.

""The insurgents, in a convoy of armed vehicles, burst into our village on a reprisal attacks, after a team of local hunters killed dozens of terrorists and recovered two Toyota Hilux vehicles, arms and ammunition used in attacking neighbouring villages and towns in Gujba and Gulani council areas of Yobe,"" the fleeing resident said in atelephone interview yesterday.

Goni Isa, a prominent politician from the village, also said that over 25 people were killed, adding that some women and children were also abducted by the armed militants at Wednesday night.

""My wife and six children are among several women and female adults abducted by the insurgents. They mercilessly butchered our people and killed many with guns. The military men around tried to repel them but they were over-powered by the militants,"" Isa said.

He said that hunters attacked Boko Haram stronghold in Gujba town where they ambushed their leader (Amir) and killed some of the militants, which led to Wednesday's reprisal attack on Katarko village.

Ya Fati Umar, a female resident who also escaped to Damaturu, said that the insurgents tied the hands of victims to their backs, before they were killed by slitting their throats. ""Two of my nephews were slaughtered in my presence. I cannot tell you how I escaped their onslaught,"" said Fati.

It was also gathered that the Boko Haram terrorists have killed more residents of Baga town as they were fleeing the border fishing and farming settlement, after the insurgents torched several houses and shops and took over a military base of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF) last Saturday.

Speaking yesterday in a telephone interview in Maiduguri over the killings, the District Head of Baga, Alhaji Baba Abba Hassan, however, denied media reports that over 2,000 Baga residents were killed while fleeing to Chad and Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.

His words: ""There was no fresh attack on Baga, as reported in the media yesterday. What happened was that as the people continue to flee for safety, the insurgents pursue them, until some of them were shot dead, while others got drowned into the Lake waters last night. There was no new attack on Baga on Wednesday, this is what I know.""

On the capture and control of Baga, he said: ""The terrorists did not move an inch since the first day of the attack on Saturday. But I cannot tell you the actual number of people killed because many were pursued to the bushes and killed.

""The terrorists have also destroyed hundreds of houses in Baga because they were well prepared, they came with dozens of vehicles and first attacked the Multi National Joint Task Force location. There was resistance initially, but later, the insurgents had an upper hand. They remained in Baga since the first day of the attack. ""Hundreds of our people are now taking refuge in Maiduguri. The Borno State government has sent many buses to the bushes to rescue the fleeing displaced persons.""

The Coordinator, National Information Centre, Mr. Mike Omeri, who disclosed the Federal Government's move to recapture Baga at a routine briefing on the security situation of the country, stated that situation has improved since the last attack on the town.

His words: ""While confirming the presence of Boko Haram in some location in Yobe, Adamawa and Borno states, the centre wishes to inform that situation in Baga has improved since the last attack on the town. Security forces are working to ensure the full liberation of the strategic town and other places close to it.

""Government is constantly reviewing the situation with regard to the fight against insurgency in order to improve logistic requirement and support for the security forces to enable the defeat of insurgents. Officers are being trained and re-trained to upgrade their skills and capacity, while increased surveillance, intelligent sharing and synergy are being enhanced.

""We therefore, want to assure citizens in all the troubled areas in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa that government is working steadfastly to stabilise theses areas. Top in our concern is that this be achieved with minimal, if any, loss of precious lives of our citizens.""

Omeri maintained that consultations with the security chiefs (serving and retired), traditional rulers and other critical stakeholders with a view to bringing their varied experiences to bear on the fight against the insurgency are on-ongoing.

""We want to encourage well meaning leaders to emulate friendly countries who have thrown their weight behind Nigeria in this fight. The path of patriotism and honour is not to wait until we get into government before we can contribute to save the precious lives of our citizens.""

Speaking further, the NIC Coordinator also urged influential Nigerians to apply patriotic wisdom and courage to speak the truth when addressing national issues in order to reduce perceived tension and generate goodwill and hope among Nigerian citizens.

""We believe that the unity of purpose so far exhibited by Nigerians in the fight against insurgency must be sustained by all, irrespective of political persuasions, religious beliefs and ideological position.""

Meanwhile, the Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), The Most Revd. Nicholas Okoh has urged Nigerians to come together and relentlessly engage in efforts that would put an end to Boko Haram insurgency in the Northern part of the country.

Okoh gave the advice yesterday while addressing bishops and archbishops in Anglican Church during their annual retreat with the theme: ""The 21st God's Ambassadors in the Anglican Church"" going on at the Ibru Centre, Agbarha-Otor, Delta State.

The cleric who lamented the Boko Haram insurgency that has turned the affected areas into war zone, with killing and maiming and scattering of families, warned that if there is no co-operation to end the menace of the sect, the danger of the terrorists overrunning the country should not be undermined.

Okoh also said it has become necessary for other Nigerians to assist the victims of insurgency with cash and kind, urging Nigerians to note that if they fail to act swiftly, similar situation may be closed to their door steps.

In the same vein, the Archbishop of the Ecclesiastical Province of Bendel, the Dean, Church of Nigeria and Bishop of Esan Diocese, Most Rev. Friday Imaekhai, remarked that the situation in the country today had long been determined. He likened it to a seed that was long planted, the fruits of which we are now reaping.

""Things are not just happening and it is most unfortunate that they are happening during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan. Although people tend to claim that what is going on in the North is not a religious war, everything happening points to that direction, where churches are burnt, people are forced to renounce their faith, Christians are recklessly killed with their families scattered and Islam is being forced on the people as the mode of worship.

""When we look at the history of the nation, we would see all the efforts of some of the past leaders from the military to civilian trying to Islamise the country and the fact that Nigeria has been sold to the Muslim world.""

Imaekhai continued: ""Boko Haram says it hates everything 'Western' and at a time, the sect called on President Jonathan to be a Muslim.

We were dragged into Organization of Islamic countries (OIC) and by implication, Nigeria is a Muslim country which means that whatever is happening on other Muslim countries should be repeated here, and if we would not deceive ourselves, we can see the handwriting on the wall.

""We pray that the nation comes out of the coming election successfully and as a Church, it is our prayer that God would lead us through this difficult time and give us credible leaders that will make for stability of the country and also make the rule of law to operate where people have freedom of worship and serve their God in their own way.""

The Bishop of Gombe Diocese, Rt. Rev. Henry Ndukuba, described what has been going on in the North as economic, physical, social and spiritual battle that may not end soon and after it has ended, things may not be the same in the affected areas in the next ten years as it is easy to destroy, but difficult to build."

A National Conscience Party candidate for Bayelsa State House of Assembly election in 2015, Mr. Michael Agbalaze, has been abducted.

Agbalaze was whisked away from his residence at Azikoro Village Area of Bayelsa in the early hours of Monday by gunmen allegedly adorning police camouflage.

It was learnt that when his assailants called, they took him away along with one of his aides, identified only as Monday.

Agbalaze, a former Tarakiri Rural Development Area Chairman, is one of the foremost contenders for the Assembly seat in Sagbama Constituency 1 where the current House Majority Leader, Mr. Peter Akpe, is contesting.

Agbalaze’s friend, Mr. Oyakemeagbeagha Kpoku, alias General Oyas, told Punch Metro on Tuesday that the victim was forcibly taken away by people in police camouflage around 3am on Monday.

Oyas claimed Agbalaze’s assailants came in three vehicles and bundled him into one of the vehicles with his aide.

Oyas, a former Niger Delta militant, urged Agbalaze’s captors to bring him unhurt, warning that hell will be let loose in the constituency if they refused to release him to enable him to campaign for the election.

He vowed that if Agbalaze’s abductors failed to release him before the election, no election would be held in Sagbama Constituency 1.

The abduction of the Assembly candidate has been generating tension in Governor Seriake Dickson constituency as sources said it was politically motivated.

A source, who craved anonymity, alleged that the abduction was an intimidation to make him stop his campaign to go to the House.

The source said Agbalaze is more popular among the candidates in the area, noting that his current travail was just to make him chicken out of the contest.

Efforts to get police position on the abduction were not successful as Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa Police Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, failed to pick several calls made to his mobile phone."

Gunmen on Wednesday night attacked the Ekiti State secretariat of the All Progressives Congress in Ado-Ekiti and destroyed the flags and posters of the party’s candidates.

According to a statement issued by the state Publicity Secretary, Taiwo Olatunbosun, the gunmen came in four Hilux vehicles and a car to unleash the mayhem.

“Shortly before they arrived, streetlights along Ajilosun Street where the APC secretariat is located were switched off. The hoodlums wounded the security man at the gate of the APC office,” the statement said.

Olatunbosun claimed that the Director of Department of State Service, Mr. Samuel Tamuno and the Commissioner of Police, Taiwo Lakanu, had been informed about the development.

When contacted, Lakanu confirmed the crisis saying, “I don’t think there was any sporadic shooting there. But I have drafted my men there to maintain peace and order.”

The party said Governor Ayo Fayose had concluded plans to hold a rally at Fajuyi Roundabout in Ado-Ekiti on Saturday in a bid to disrupt the APC presidential rally scheduled for the same day in the city.

“Fajuyi roundabout is a major road to Ekitiparapo Square along NTA road where the APC is holding its presidential rally on Saturday.

“The Independent National Electoral Commission’s rule prevents two parties to hold rallies on same day in the same state capital. The PDP held its rally about two weeks ago,” the statement added.

Thousands of PDP supporters had thronged the venue of the campaign rally as early as 9am, with traffic gridlock on major routes.

Kambari, a village five kilometres from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State has been razed by the deadly Boko Haram insurgents.

A security source who preferred anonymity, said the terrorists killed 15 persons including the village leader in the attack.

He said, “The terrorists attacked Kambari village about five kilometres to Maiduguri around 5:00 am on Friday and killed 15 persons, setting the entire hamlet ablaze.”

He insisted that the insurgents were aiming for Maiduguri, which they had the intention of making the capital of their caliphate, Ibrahim said, “After they tried without success to gain access to Maiduguri through Konduga, they turned through another route and attacked Kambari.”

One of the victims of the attack, Abibat Modu, who fled to Maiduguri, said, “They killed two of my children when they attacked our village.”

“They shot my children dead. I had to leave the village with my grandchildren because we have lost our house,” she said.

“The insurgents also killed our village head. In fact, I counted 15 dead bodies,” she claimed.

It was gathered that the two girls had left home that morning to fetch firewood at the bush when an unknown assailant attacked them with a machete.

Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Wole Ogodo, who confirmed the incident, said police detectives visited the scene of crime, noting that photographs of the corpses were taken before they were removed to the general hospital mortuary for autopsy.

He said while no suspect was arrested, the Police had spread its drag net to ensure the culprit was apprehended.

An 87-year-old woman, Mrs Olapeju Fasonu, was on Sunday night abducted by gunmen in her residence at Araromi-Obu in Odigbo Local Government Area of Ondo State.

The abducted woman is the mother of a former Commissioner for Agriculture in the state, Chief Bunmi Fasonu.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the incident occurred at about 9 p.m. at No. 35 Ajewole Street, Araromi-Obu, in the presence of two relatives.

A member of the family, Mr Tayo Ikujuni who is a Senior Editor with NAN, said the gunmen, numbering about three, scaled the fence of the house and over-powered the occupants.

According to him, the octogenarian, who is ill with malaria, was taken away by her abductors in a waiting car.

He wondered why anybody would want to disturb the peace of the elderly woman when she was not involved in politics or in any feud with anybody.

Ikujuni said the whereabouts of the woman had yet to be ascertained, adding that the incident had been reported to the Police.

Mr Isaac Eke, the state Commissioner of Police, who confirmed the incident to NAN, said the police were on the trail of the perpetrators.

He promised that the hoodlums would be brought to book."

The Speaker of the Cross River State House of Assembly, Mr. Larry Odey, on Wednesday disclosed that armed men stormed his Calabar official residence on Tuesday night and made attempt on his life.

The Speaker, who said this in Calabar, noted that members of his household including himself were lucky to have escaped unhurt. He however said his security officers sustained gunshots.

He said his security aides battled to disarm the assassins and in the process, they sustained gunshots which were not fatal.

Asked if he suspected armed robbers or hired political assassins, Odey, a governorship candidate under the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, said he was not in position to determine that.

He said, “I am not in a position to confirm that. The Police who have since launched investigations will have to tell us who the gunmen were. And how many have been arrested so far.”

A source said the gunmen successfully scaled the fence of the Speaker’s official residence and shot sporadically to scare the security men.

The source said, “The assailants’ bullets hit his bullet-proof door where he was. The hoodlums were actually very daring. They scaled the fence and actually shot at where the Speaker was, but his door, of course, is bullet-proof and the pellets hit the door and that saved the situation.

“The Speaker’s police escort who intercepted them was shot in the hand and he is presently receiving treatment in the hospital.”

When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Hogan Bassey, confirmed the incident, saying investigation was on to unravel the perpetrators.

“Yes, there was a problem in his house and one of our men was shot. We are investigating the matter at the moment,” he said.

Fulani herdsmen

Gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen opened fire on a crowd of people at Yangal village in Zango-Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing seven on the spot and injuring 12 others.

The village was thrown into mourning on Tuesday night, as the campaign train of Governor Mukhtar Yero reached in the southern part of the state.

Among the seven persons killed was an 87-year-old woman, simply identified as Mama Hauwa Bello.

The acting Chairman of Zango-Kataf Local Government Area, Mr. Jonathan Asake, who confirmed the incident, told newsmen that he got a distress call at about 12am on Wednesday that some armed Fulani men attacked a crowd of people in the Yangal village.

Asake, also a former member of the House of Representatives, said when he got to the scene of the incident, he assisted in evacuating five corpses and 12 injured persons to the St. Louis Hospital, Zonkwa, about 15 kilometres from Yangal village.

He said it was unfortunate that the attack came when the governor’s campaign train was slated to arrive the area on Thursday.

He said that no arrest was made. According to him, before soldiers arrived the scene of the attack, the gunmen had fled.

Asake said, “I reached Yangal village this morning and met scores of angry, sticks-and knife-wielding youths who wanted to descend on me for coming late. I was told that an old woman had passed on and had been buried.

“According to the villagers, two Fulani men were sighted around 9pm on Tuesday night around the venue of the celebration. One with a gun and the other had nothing on him. Not suspecting anything, the group went on with their cerebration.

“Then the armed man opened fire on the crowd with his AK 47 rifle. He killed five people on the spot and two later died in the hospital. I saw the corpses and those 12 that were injured. We evacuated them to the St. Luis Hospital. I left the hospital around 5am this morning. Of those injured, nine were critically hit, and we have taken them to a more equipped hospital in Jos, Plateau State.

“By the time soldiers arrived the village, the two men had fled and the village was in confusion.

“This is calculated either to frustrate the governorship campaign of the Peoples Democratic Party or it was a diversion to steal cows. Governor Mukhtar Ramalan Yero is expected to arrive Zango Kataf, tomorrow (today) to continue with his campaign tour, and we know how desperate the opposition are to unseat our government by all means.”

Meanwhile, Yero has condemned the killing, while campaigning in the southern part of the state.

It was learnt that rather than pay on-the-spot visit to the scene of the attack, the governor mandated his deputy to visit the area and went ahead with his campaign in other parts of the area (southern Kaduna).

The governor, through his Director-General on Media and Public Affairs, Mallam Ahmed Mayaki, said he was saddened by the development. He said the attack was an attempt by miscreants to cause confusion and heighten tension in the state.

He called on the people of the area and the entire state to remain calm while he directed the State Emergency Management Agency to immediately move to the affected community to provide the victims with the necessary support and assistance.

Yero also commiserated with the victims’ families, just as he said the hospital bills of those injured in the attack would be paid by the state government.

“It is rather sad that some people will stop at nothing in achieving their selfish goals, including shedding the blood of innocent citizens of the state,” he said.

Members of Boko Haram sect

Chadian soldiers have smoked out the Boko Haram insurgents out of Malumfatori town in north-eastern Nigeria, a top security source said.

One of our correspondents gathered on Thursday that the recapture of the town, which lies near the borders of Chad and Niger, followed two days of fighting between the insurgents and the soldiers.

Both ground and air forces are reported to have been used in the assault.

It was learnt that the Chadian soldiers moved into the town which was earlier seized by the Boko Haram sect after crossing Lake Chad. It is not known if the operation was approved by Nigeria.

However, the Nigerian military confirmed that the town had been recaptured but said that the feat was performed by soldiers from the Multinational Task involved in the ongoing operation against the insurgents in the North-East.

The Multi-National Joint Task Force comprises military personnel from Nigeria, Chad and Niger. Although Cameroon was supposed to be one of the troops contributing nation to the force, its troops had yet to participate in the activities of the force.

It was added that the area had always been the focus of the activities of the Nigeria military especially the aerial surveillance and patrol activities of the Nigerian Force.

On Thursday, the Director, Defence Information, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, said in a text message sent to one of our correspondents that Malafatori fall within the area covered by the operations of the Multi National Joint Task Force.

Olukolade said that the Nigeria Air Force had been involved in aerial operations in the Malumfatori axis for two days as part of the ongoing effort against terrorism.

He said, “Malumfatori is within the area of operation covered by the Multi National Joint Task Force of which Chad has always been a part.

“The Nigerian Air Force has also been conducting air mission there for two days now, it is all part of the ongoing efforts against terrorism.”

However, people who fled the area were reported to have said they had seen military planes bombing the town.

Some of those who left the town during the fighting were reported to have crossed into Niger.

Meanwhile, reports from the area said fighting had now spread to a nearby town, Abadam.

Meanwhile, the African Union heads of state are due to discuss the crisis over Boko Haram at their summit beginning on Friday (today).

Ghanaian President John Mahama had said the leaders must produce a “specific plan of action” to “deal permanently” with Boko Haram.

The convoy of President Goodluck Jonathan on Thursday came under attack from stone-hurling youths in Jalingo, Taraba State, and in the process broke windshields and windows of several vehicles.

This is even as Jonathan on Thursday asked God to forgive those who accuse him of being behind Boko Haram insurgency in Adamawa State and other parts of the North East.

The attack took place as the President’s convoy was enroute to a campaign rally in Yola, Adamawa State capital. The Police however used tear gas to disperse the mob.

This is the third time Jonathan’s convoy has been attacked since campaign for the February general election began.

The first was in Katsina, Katsina State while the second took place in Bauchi, Bauchi State, where youths flung shoes and plastic bottles on Jonathan’s podium at a rally. Some of the president’s security details were hurt in the process.

Before the attack in Jalingo, the youths had shouted on soldiers who guarded the President’s billboards and posters in the town.

“Why are they using soldiers and other security operatives? They should be deployed to Sambisa and fight with Boko Haram, not with innocent civilians,” one youth yelled as he tore down a poster of the President.

Same day in Kano State, the convoy of Minister of Education, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau and PDP governatorial candidate in the state, Sagir Takai, was attacked by suspected hoodlums around 8:40pm while on their way from Rogo Local Government Area of the state where they had gone for a rally.

Although, five vehicles were destroyed, the minister escaped unscathed. It took the intervention of security operatives to disperse the mob.

Meanwhile, speaking at the rally held at Ribadu Square in Yola, Jonathan descended heavily on those who accuse him of being behind Boko Haram insurgency in the state, adding that only mad people will accuse him of executing such dastardly act against the people. He, however, asked God to forgive those behind the allegation.

Furthermore, Jonathan added: “Only a mad person can insinuate that the president is supporting Boko Haram.

Jonathan, who announced the liberation of Michika Local Government area of the state by Nigerian troops, added that its only one local government area of the state that is left in the hand of insurgents. He added that the Nigerian troops are battling to liberate it.

The President said that in 2012, he had highest votes in Adamawa State, adding that nothing on earth would make him kill those that gave him large number votes to become president of the nation.

He said that he has no reason to sponsor the killing of children, women and the aged, adding that he has nothing to benefit from such deleterious actions.

He said: “In the last election, I secured more than 65 percent of the votes in the state which is even twice the votes I got from my home state of Bayelsa; even from political considerations, killing of Adamawa people will amount to political suicide."

Also, in a separate incident, gunmen operating on a speedboat have kidnapped four employees of the Nigerian Agip Oil Company.

The two incidents were said to have occurred on Monday in Nembe and Southern Ijaw local government areas of Bayelsa.

The attack that led to the death of the policeman was said to have happened at about 5pm in Opiama, Nembe LGA.

The slain policeman, a sergeant, who was identified as Mathew Simon, was said to have been hit by the assailants’ bullets.

It was further learnt that the patrol van was drafted to guard workers constructing the Ogbia-Nembe Road.

Though the mission of the gunmen were unclear, a security source hinted that they must have arrived the area to abduct some of the workers.

He recalled that some of the workers constructing the road were kidnapped in a similar way in 2014.

The source, who did not want to be mentioned, said, “This time around, they were not successful as the policemen engaged them in a gun duel. One of the policemen died. However, police claimed that they killed two of the militants.”

The source also said the policemen claimed that the suspected militants escaped with the dead bodies of their two colleagues in the duel.

On the Southern Ijaw incident, the four abducted Agip workers were said to have been taken to an unknown place in the creeks by gunmen.

It was gathered that the workers were travelling on a speedboat from Amassomma to Ogoimbiri, all in Southern Ijaw area.

“Their speedboat was double-crossed by gun-wielding men who shot sporadically into the air to frighten them. The gunmen took them into their boat and zoomed off. Our river is a death trap,” the security source said.

When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, said he had yet to get details of the incident."

Kwara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed

The peace accord signed by the 16 political parties and their governorship candidates contesting in the forthcoming elections in Kwara State appeared shattered on Wednesday as political thugs attacked the advance team of Governor Abdulfattah Ahmed’s campaign in Isapa, in the Ekiti Local Government Area of the state.

Ahmed is the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in Kwara State and the attackers were suspected to belong to the Peoples Democratic Party in the state.

Isapa is the home town of Kwara State PDP governorship candidate, Senator Simeon Ajibola.

Two members of the APC were shot while several others sustained injuries as they scampered for safety.

One of the shot victims was said to be in critical condition as of the time of this report.

Our correspondent learnt that one of the victims was shot on the left leg, while another victim’s earlobe was attacked with a machete.

The APC governorship candidate and the state APC Leader, Senator Bukola Saraki, who were among the APC leaders in the campaign train defied the news of the attack and went ahead to address the rally.

Ahmed described the attack as unfortunate. He however said he was committed to peace and violence-free election despite the attack on his party members.

He said, “We have remained committed to a peaceful campaign everywhere we have gone and we have been to virtually all the communities in this state without any problem.

“It is quite unfortunate that as we were coming here our advance team was met with resistance by some misguided youths. Some of our people were shot and they have been rushed to the hospital.

“One of them was in very critical condition and we don’t know what will happen to him but we are praying that he survives it.

“It is very unfortunate and it was not expected because we have been carrying out our campaign peacefully and we intend to continue to do so and we would not allow any misguided group to truncate our record of peace in the state.”

Three leaders of the All Progressives Congress in Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State on Tuesday escaped death as their houses were reportedly attacked by gunmen.

They are the chairman of Ifo Ward 1, Aderibigbe Asimiyu; another leader from the same ward, Fatai Akinlagun, and a youth leader in ward 2, Segun Abolade.

The gunmen, who were said to have wore masks and numbering about 15, stormed the office of Asimiyu and homes of Akinlagun and Abolade, but they were unlucky as their targets were not found there.

They were reported to have shot sporadically into the air to scare away the people.

At least four persons were feared killed and 10 houses burnt as a result of a clash between Christians and Muslims in Babale village of Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State.

The peace, hitherto enjoyed in the area, despite series of crisis that engulfed Jos, the state capital in recent times, was disrupted on Tuesday, when a car that was trying to avoid a ditch ran into a motorcycle and killed the rider and the passengers. The mayhem that followed spilled over to yesterday.

Daily Times gathered that, the Peugeot 406 station wagon, driven by one Samsudeen Mohammad Umar, of Number 6, Rikkos New Layout, was on high speed on the Jos-Bauchi road, when he noticed a ditch by the roadside, but in his bid to avoid running into it and somersaulting, knocked down the motorcycle rider and his two passengers who were Christians and residents of the village.

This however made the villagers to rush out and in seeing the gravity of the accident, some of them insisted that the ditch, which was dug by a church within that vicinity, must be closed up. The ditch was part of the safety measures put in place by the church to force drivers plying the Jos- Bauchi road to slow down and avoid knocking down their church members, an eye witness said.

While some villagers insisted that the ditch must be closed up especially as it had caused a lot of accidents to those not familiar with the route, the Christians, especially the church members insisted that the ditch must remain saying that the death of the two persons on the motorcycle was as a result of the carelessness and over-speeding of the vehicle owner.

The ensuing argument led to the clash between the Christians and Muslims and as the news spread so also were the two groups taking up arms against one another.

It was further gathered that in less than two hours no fewer than 10 houses had been torched and two more people killed.

As at the time of filing this report, fighting was still going on in the village while policemen had been drafted to the area to maintain peace.

The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Emmanuel Abu, who confirmed the story, blamed the youth for the rampage. He said they became violent and started destroying properties.

He confirmed the arrest of two persons in connection with the incident while investigation is still going on."

It was learnt that the youths had blocked most of the roads in the town as a security precaution against any attack during the campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari(retd.), in the town.

The youths reportedly asked to check the trailer and when the soldiers refused, they (the youths) forcefully climbed the vehicle and also made a bonfire on the road to make it difficult for the soldiers to move the trailer.

The action of the youths was said to have angered the soldiers, who, according to eyewitnesses, resorted to shooting at the youths.

The five died in the confrontation while many others sustained injuries.

A security source told our correspondent that it was wrong for the youths to accost soldiers.

The source said, “It was an affront on the military for some armed youths under any guise to accost military officials on the road.

“They left our men with no other choice but to shoot at them.”

The source said the trailer was contracted by the military to convey the ammunition when the initial Army vehicle ferrying the ammunition developed fault on the way.

An undisclosed number of inmates on Friday gained entry into the armory of the Calabar Prison , Cross River State, and attempted to escape after a gun duel but were overpowered by a combined team of security agents.

The incident, which occurred at about 11am, was said to have caused pandemonium as residents of neighbouring Afokang, Iman and Jebbs in Calabar South axis of the metropolis scampered to safety during the gun duel.

The Afokang end of the prison fence was broken during the process while two inmates were said to have escaped, but the state controller of prisons, Mr. Clement Udosen, said no inmate escaped.

It was, however, not clear how the inmates gained access to the armory, but it was learnt that a total of 53 rifles were recovered after the incident while one could not be accounted for.

The prison armed squad was said to have been overpowered but they immediately called for reinforcement and the situation was brought under control after 40 minutes of gun duel with the inmates.

An anonymous prison official said about 17 hardened criminals consisting kidnappers, drug barons, ex-militants and armed robbers were brought to the prison two weeks ago.

He said their arrival sent an alert that something untoward might happen.

An eyewitness, Solomon Okoro, said two of the inmates escaped through the broken fence but one of them was apprehended by vigilant youths in the neighbouring Afokang Street while the other escaped.

Okoro said, “We heard gun shots at about 11am. Although gun shots within the prison yard is not new to us, but this time it lasted for a long time. That was how we got to know that there was problem. We stopped hearing the shots and that was when the reinforced team started coming.

“We learnt the inmates exhausted their bullets. At the end of which, the wall was broken, two escaped but one was apprehended by some community youths.”

Reacting to the development, the state Controller of the Cross River State Command of the Nigeria Prisons Service, Mr. Clement Udosen, said no inmate escaped, confirming that they actually got access to the armoury.

He said, “By 11 o’clock in the morning, I was in my office in the headquarters, the DC in charge of this prison called me that there was serious problem in the yard so I came and the whole place was filled with people with rifles, people who had come here to help us, the soldiers, police, civil defence, state security service and others.

“Two of the cells’ inmates organized themselves and overpowered the prison staff and rushed to where we have the armoury, seized the rifles there and went back firing at the staff. In that confusion they broke other cells and the whole yard was filled with inmates. They carried what they could get to break the fence.

“Luckily for now they have all been rounded up and nobody has escaped. A lot of people have been injured and one staff had been rushed to the hospital. Right now the doctors with his team are treating those injured. On casualties (deaths), it is the doctor that would ascertain that because he is treating them.”

“Most of those injured are the inmates. Three of our staff were wounded and one rushed to the hospital. There was no external invasion. It was an attempted jailbreak and luckily nobody escaped. The other security agencies helped us especially the 13th Brigade of the Nigerian Army because they stationed 10 solders here, morning and night and these are the ones that really helped us. They encircled the perimeter fence, as they tried to come out of the hole, the soldiers were there and they could not come out.”"

Members of Boko Haram sect

Head of Chibok Elders Forum, Pogo Bitrus, has told the Associated Press of France, that at least 30 people lost their lives during attacks by fleeing Boko Haram insurgents on two villages – Thlaimakalama and Gatamarwa, on Thursday night.

The communities which are near Chibok, a sleepy town in troubled Borno State where around 276 secondary school girls were seized last year, were torched by the terrorists who also destroyed valuable property.

“From information coming from residents of the two villages, at least 30 people were killed in the attacks,” Bitrus said.

A resident of Chibok, Luka Haruna, confirmed Bitrus’ claim, saying: “The two villages were completely destroyed.”

According to the AFP which quoted eyewitnesses, the latest attacks happened about 11:00am as the insurgents fled, a nearby town, Askira Uba, following intense military offensive in the area in recent days.

Bitrus said: “The insurgents mowed everything in sight as they fled Askira Uba and these two villages which they passed through became targets. They opened fire on residents and set houses on fire as they drove in a huge convoy.”

The Boko Haram terror group, which has resisted peaceful resolution of its grievances, began its attack on the country about five years ago.

The sect has yet to release the over 200 schoolgirls it kidnapped over nine months ago in Chibok despite appeal by the Federal Government and members of the international community."

Recounting how the operation that lasted for about 45 minutes happened, Temitope’s younger sister, Yetunde, a student of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ogun State, said the robbers, numbering about 12, besieged their residence at about 1:30am on Monday and started shooting sporadically.

She said the robbers had earlier robbed a house opposite their building owned by a widow and retiree.

“We had earlier heard the noise coming from the next building which sent a signal to us that robbers were in the area. But later they came to our house peeping through the windows and threatening that we should open the door or face the dire consequences.

“They said they were not in our house for tea party. They broke the windows and lit the living room with their torches and started shooting sporadically into the inner side of the bungalow when we didn’t open the door on time. It was at this time that I ran inside to inform our father who instructed us to shout.

“But as we were shouting, Temitope was already shot in the stomach and was in the pool of his blood. At this stage, the robbers had already entered the living room and started beating our mummy and everybody.

In fact, when they sighted daddy, they beat him mercilessly,” she said.

Unknown gunmen on Friday fired gunshots at the convoy of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Benue State, Samuel Ortom, damaging three vehicles in the process.

The incident took place during the funeral of a journalist, who was also a lecturer at the Benue State University (BSU), Makurdi, Samson Sambe, at Adikpo, Kwande Local Government Area of the state.

Saturday Independent gathered that sporadic gunshots rented the air as Ortom was delivering a funeral oration in honour of the deceased, sending sympathisers scampering for safety.

However, no one was hurt. The gunmen sped off and left the scene of the incident.

The media adviser to Ortom, Tahav Agerzua, who confirmed the incident said the former minister has formally lodged a complaint to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) at the Adikpo Police Station.

He said: “In spite of the shots, Ortom concluded his speech before he was informed that three of his vehicles parked near the Magistrate Court close to Adikpo Comprehensive College (ACC), Adikpo, had been shot.”

Agerzua explained that “The glass on the owner’s side of a branded Ford Hillux van was shattered and the bullet exited through the roof even as another branded pick up van was hit at the tail board and the bullet came out from the left side (of the vehicle)” and flattened the right front tyre.”

He attributed the attack to a group headed by a prominent Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) supporter in Adikpo town."

Unknown gunmen struck again in Rivers State, kidnapping the one of the aides to the State Governor, Mr. Freddy Ndigbara.

Ndigbara, who is an anchorman for Governor Rotimi Amaechi events inside and outside Government

House, Port Harcourt, was whisked away on Sunday by hoodlums in Kaani Community, Khana Local Government Area.

It was gathered that Ndigbara, who is popularly called Freddie by Government House workers, was accosted and forced into a waiting car by the gunmen during a ward rally organised by the All Progressives Congress in the area.

Oblivious of the danger lying ahead of him, the kidnap victim was said to have travelled from Port Harcourt to his home town to be part of the rally.

The hoodlums, according to an eyewitness, had stormed the rally with a red Toyota Highlander sports utility van, made a quick search for their target before forcing him into the car.

It was gathered that the organisers were planning to arrange the canopy for the rally when the kidnappers struck.

The PUNCH learnt that Ndigbara’s abductors immediately sped off to an unknown destination, just as members of the party in Kaani, Ward Six, took cover to avoid being shot by the suspected kidnappers.

Speaking on the incident, a former Chief Press Secretary to Amaechi, Mr. Blessing Wikina, said a group of gunmen, suspected to be thugs working for the Peoples Democratic Party, invaded the rally and took Ndigbara away."

The incident occurred when Engr. Mustapha Bukar, the APC senatorial candidate for Daura zone, alongside other party members, stormed the region to campaign.

Majigiri village is where former Government House Chief of Staff and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate for House of Representatives, Salisu Yusuf, hails from.

Some of the villagers, who spoke with our correspondent, alleged they were attacked unprovoked by APC supporters for failing to show support for the party’s candidates.

The incident also saw a vehicle, a local food silo and animal food reserve set on fire, while police that accompanied the APC candidates fired several shots and canisters of teargas to dispel the clashing sides.

Yusuf described the incident in his village as unfortunate, adding that politics should not be seen as a do-or-die affair.

He wondered why candidates seeking votes from his community would allow the area to be attacked and their food storage facility burnt to the ground.

He however called on the police not to take sides but to ensure justice in the matter.

But Bukar, the APC senatorial candidate, said contrary to insinuation, it was his campaign train that was attacked when they were in the village.

“We were attacked. I wonder how we can attack a place where we went to seek their vote. We visited so many places like that.

“We greeted the village head and left for the location where we were to speak to the people. The police are in a better position to tell you what happened.”"

Unconfirmed reports at press time indicated that three persons were killed while scores of people fled the area to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

The fighting that started at Olosha area between members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, youths last Thursday, spread to Mushin and Oshodi.

Since the crisis started, properties worth millions of naira have been destroyed, as several commuter buses were set ablaze at Oshodi.

The crisis disrupted activities in the area and commuter bus operators avoided plying the area.

When our reporter attempted to visit the scene of the mayhem yesterday, people were running in various directions to avoid being attacked by the rampaging thugs.

When contacted, Lagos State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Kenneth Nwosu, promised to get back to our correspondent but failed to do so at the time of going to press.

Meanwhile, it was gathered that the police have arrested over 20 members of PDP in connection with last Thursday’s clash between the NURTW and the youths at Oshodi.

Reacting to the arrest, campaign team of PDP governorship candidate in the state, Jimi Agbaje, accused the police of arresting PDP members at the behest of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to frustrate Agaje’s campaign.

According to a statement signed by its Director of Media and Publicity, Remi Adefulu, the campaign team said APC’s “tactics would not deter Agbaje’s resolve to win the coming election in a free and fair contest.”

Adefulu accused the police at Mosafejo Police Station of going from house-to-house to effect illegal arrest of PDP members, an allegation the police public relations officer dismissed as unfounded."

Gunmen on Thursday again kidnapped an educationist in Kogi State, Paulina Audu.

The victim, who is a retired headmistress, was abducted by gunmen at her residence at Nagazi , in Adavi Local Government Area of the state at about 5am.

Our correspondent gathered that the victim was kidnapped as she was on her way for morning devotion in an unnamed church.

A source told journalists in Lokoja that Audu attended morning devotion in her church.

The source, who craved anonymity for fear of threat to her life, said the retired headmistress was coming out of her house to attend the devotion when the bandits, who had led siege to her residence, suddenly emerged, pointed gun at her and bundled her into her vehicle in which the driver was waiting to covey the headmistress to church.

The gunmen were said to have dragged her driver out of the vehicle and driven the woman away to an unknown destination.

Police Public Relations, Kogi State Command, Mr. Sola Adebayor, told our correspondent that he had not been briefed on the kidnap.

On Monday, some gunmen had kidnapped an 80-year-old American missionary, Rev. Phyllinx Sogor, who runs the Hope Academy Nursery and Primary school, Emi-Woro in Ajaokuta Local Government of Kogi State.

Sogor has not been released by her abductors, who had reportedly demanded N30m to free her."

One of the leaders of a kidnap syndicate that abducted Samuel Okpara, a medical doctor in Port Harcourt, was on Friday killed during a gun duel with security operatives at Obite Waterfront in Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State.

Okpara, who was abducted last week, died in the kidnappers’ den, even as medical doctors have continued to protest the incessant kidnapping of their colleagues in the state.

Confirming the death of the kidnappers’ gang leader, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Dan Bature, told the protesting doctors that his men engaged the hoodlums in a shootout at about 5am.

Bature disclosed that a police corporal was injured during the gun duel that lasted for several minutes.

He assured that efforts had been intensified to rescue kidnap victims still held hostage by kidnappers.

Meanwhile, the State Chairman of Nigeria Medical Association, Dr. Furo Green, said doctors had decided to embark on seven-day mourning over Okpara’s death.

Green said, “Adewale Olugbenga and Jack Ohvunda Omodu were tortured, beaten with rods and hammers and denied food and water, medication and eventually shot and released.

“The last of them, Dr. Sam Okpara, who was kidnapped on Wednesday, February 18, 2015, died in the hands of his captors after five days in captivity and his body was dumped in a cassava farm at Borokiri axis of Port Harcourt, precisely behind Comprehensive School.”

Green added that four medical doctors had also received kidnap threats from unknown persons, maintaining that doctors were no longer safe to practise in the state.

A former security detail to Delta State Governor, Mr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, Christian Eza, was on Thursday night killed by a police corporal, Bala Ibrahim, during a patrol in Bauchi.

Until the incident, the victim was the Commander of the Mobile Police 10 unit in Bauchi State.

According to reports, Eza was returning home from work around 11:30pm when he stumbled on a team of police officers on patrol at a section of the metropolis.

The deceased reportedly stopped his vehicle and demanded that Ibrahim, who was wearing MOPOL khaki when he was not part of the special unit, explain his action.

In the process of trying to disarm the corporal, Eza was shot in the chest at close range and later pronounced dead at the teaching hospital in Bauchi.

The state police command has, however, arrested all the personnel in the patrol team as well as ordered the incident investigated."

The Director of Defence Information, Maj.-Gen Chris Olukolade, has said that troops have recaptured more towns from the members of the Boko Haram sect.

Olukolade said in a statement on Friday that the troops handed out a crushing defeat to the insurgents and recovered the headquarters of Gulani Local Government Area of Yobe State, Bara, and the headquarters of Madagali Local Government area, Gulag, from them in the early hours of Friday.

He said that the troops also flushed out terrorists from other locations such as Shikah, Fikayel, Tetebah, Buza, Kamla and Bumsa, during the two-day operation.

According to Olukolade, many insurgents were killed in the fierce fighting that preceded the liberation of the communities.

The Defence spokesman said that the troops recovered and destroyed several arms and ammunition, vehicles and other equipment.

According to him, the items recovered included anti-air craft guns, general purpose machine guns, barrel grenade launchers, rifles and mortar guns.

Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan expressed confidence that troops would sustain the gains they have been recording in the fight against the Boko Haram sect.

He assured that the military would recover more territories seized by the terrorist group.

Jonathan gave the assurance when the outgoing French Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Jacques Champagne De Labriolle, visited him at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.

According to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Dr. Reuben Abati, the President said the officers and men of the Nigerian Army he met on the frontline in Borno and Adamawa states on Thursday were in high spirits, well prepared and determined to successfully complete their operations against the terrorist group.

“We have already recovered much territory and very soon our troops will clear the terrorists out of other areas not presently under our control.”

Accepting a congratulatory message from President Francois Hollande to Nigeria for recent successes of its armed forces against Boko Haram, Jonathan restated Nigeria’s appreciation of France’s support for Nigeria and its neighbours in the fight against terrorism.

He commended Hollande for organising the Paris Summit of Heads of State of Nigeria, Benin Republic, Cameroon, Niger and Chad in May 2014 to foster greater regional cooperation against terrorism and insurgency.

The President pledged that beyond the ongoing military campaign in the North-East, Nigeria would continue to implement all agreements reached at the summit to ensure lasting peace and security within its borders and in neighbouring countries.

Jonathan, however, reassured the international community of his commitment to free, fair and credible polls in the country next month.

The President wished the outgoing ambassador well in his future endeavours and urged him to always be a “good ambassador of Nigeria’’.

In his remarks, Labriolle said that France was “confident in the future of Nigeria and its ability to continue playing a huge role in Africa and world affairs.”

The ambassador also expressed delight at improved trade and economic ties between Nigeria and France in the last three years, noting that over 250 French companies are currently operating in Nigeria.

Dampar, which is a border town between Taraba and Plateau states, has witnessed series of attacks since 2013.

An eyewitness, who gave his name as Habu Usman, told National Mirror that the gunmen came from neighbouring Plateau State and invaded the village on Saturday and Sunday, killing over 20 people and injuring dozens.

Habu, who said he was taking refuge in Ibi town after he managed to flee the area, said the death toll may rise as many were said to be missing hours after the attack.

Confirming the report, Taraba Police spokesman, ASP Joseph Kwaji, said nine people including a military officer were killed in the attack.

He said armed militia men of Yergem extraction from neighbouring Plateau State were suspected to have carried out the attack.

Kwaji said no arrest was made, but a detachment of security operatives have since been drafted to the village to restore normalcy.

Taraba State House of Assembly in their sitting of Wednesday last week under motion of “urgent public importance” urged the state government to set up a peace committee to check incessant attacks on the border between Taraba, Nasarawa and Plateau States."

The runaway policeman, who said to be in his thirties, and whose name was yet to be ascertained as at the press time, reportedly engaged the squad for about 10 hours at Anifowoshe area of Pakata in the state capital.

He had been placed under surveillance for three days before security operatives eventually moved in on him knowing full well that he could be dangerous and difficult to be arrested.

At the end the incident, an unidentified military man sustained severe injury on his arm.

The area was tensionsoaked while the gun duel lasted, as residents were forced to remain indoors, while the sounds of gunshots from both sides raged.

National Mirror gathered that the gunman was hiding in the apartment he rented for his mother and wife at Anifowoshe annex when security operatives consisting of men of the Nigeria Army and Air Force swooped on him.

A resident of the area, preswho pleaded anonymity for security reasons, told National Mirror that the suspect was suspected to be a terrorist, who escaped from the superior military operations in the North East with some sophiscated weapons.

Reports said when the gun fight became intense, the suspect hid himself on the roof of the house, while the unrelenting security forces searched for him and eventually located and gunned him down.

It was gathered that the stern-looking security men surrounded the storeybuilding the suspect was taking refuge in while the fighting lasted.

The main road around Government Girls Day Secondary School in the area was blocked by the security operatives, thus preventing vehicular movement from both sides for hours.

A team of the Kwara State special security operatives, code named Operation Harmony was also drafted to join in the operation.

However, luck ran against the suspect after he allegedly exhausted the bullets in his gun, ostensibly making it possible for the operatives to overpower him.

He was said to have been severally shot on the head and leg before he eventually gave up the ghost and his lifeless body later taken away.

A resident said: “We started hearing sporadic gunshots around 2am early hours of yesterday. We thought it was political thugs that were fighting. Later, we discovered it was the Ebira man who rented an apartment for his mother and wife in the area that engaged in gun duel with security men. Among them were soldiers and Air Force.

“I think they have been on his trail for three days because they were about evicting him from the house. I knew him (the suspect) to be a policeman. But with the way he was shooting, he must be a notorious hoodlum."

An attack was on Monday averted on a mosque at Tashar Marghi in Gombi town of Adamawa State when a suspected suicide bomber was killed by hunters in the area.

A member of hunters in Yola, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “We were told by local hunters from Gombi that early today (Monday) when the Muslim faithful were observing prayers, a suicide bomber attempted to detonate a bomb at a mosque in the Tashar Marghi area of Gombi town but met his Waterloo.

“Early hours of Monday during the dawn prayers, a suicide bomber, who had two explosives on him, was shot and killed by local hunters.”

In another development, residents of Gombi town were gripped with fear after they sighted a hovercrafts in military colours, disposing of some materials, which were later discovered to be expired bombs, in the surrounding bushes.

According to a resident of the town, Mallam Kalla, who spoke on the telephone to our correspondent, the suspected bombs were deposited behind the Walawa hills by military aircrafts.

He said, “We became suspicious of the said aircraft as it kept hovering over the town for a very long time and was depositing some particles (expired bombs) which at first, we thought were real bombs.

“After a long time encircling the town, the hovercraft finally deposited weapons suspected to be bombs behind the Gombi hills; but at first, we thought they were depositing real bombs. We were later told that the military was depositing expired bombs.”

While confirming the two developments, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Adamawa State Command, Othman Abubakar, said on the telephone that the bombs in questions had expired.

He urged the residents to go about their business as the bombs would not cause any harm.

Othman added, “Yes military authorities have confirmed to us that the bombs have expired, so, people should not be scared.”

On the killing of the suspected bomber, he said the DPO of the area had confirmed the development to the police command but had yet to give details."

A video purporting to show the executions of two alleged spies was on Monday released by the Boko Haram Islamic sect.

One of the men was made to make a full confession, explaining his ‘crimes’ to the camera, before the pair were beheaded and their bodies shown to the camera.

The gruesome execution video echoes those posted by Islamic State and is the second released by Boko Haram.

The video, called ‘Harvest of Spies’, was posted on Monday on Twitter by Boko Haram, Mail Online quoted the SITE intelligence group as saying on Monday.

It started by showing a man kneeling in the foreground with a group of Boko Haram fighters approaching him holding a flag used by militant Islamist group.

In a theatrical display previously seen in the execution videos released by ISIS, the men lined up behind the victim.

The video then cuts to show two men, identified as Dawoud Muhammad and Muhammad Awlu, led by Boko Haram fighters before being made to kneel.

One Boko Haram fighter, whose face was blurred by the militant group, stood behind Dawoud Muhammad, holding a large knife.

Muhammad told the camera that he was a farmer from Baga, Borno State and wasthen made to answer a series of questions at knifepoint.

Muhammad revealed that hat he had been approached by a police officer who offered him money in exchange for infiltrating Boko Haram.

“We went to see a man from Mijka and a police officer that was with him. The officer gave me N5,000,” Muhammad said.

Muhammad was also made to confess that their mission had been to spy on the “residents who live here” (Boko Haram), and in exchange for spying, the police officer had promised him that he would “become rich and will never go back to be a farmer again.”

The camera panned from left to right in slow motion, showing Muhammad and Awlu on their knees as they were executed by Boko Haram fighters.

The video faded before the actual beheadings took place, and then showed the two men’s bodies with their heads placed upon their chests.

The video does not reveal how the spies were caught by the militants and MailOnline has yet to confirm its authenticity.

Boko Haram previously published only one beheading, of a Nigerian fighter pilot whose plane went missing in September."

Hundreds of candidates, wishing to sit Monday’s Unified Tertiary and Matriculation Examination of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, narrowly escaped death in Jos on Wednesday when policemen opened fire on them.

It was learnt that policemen were called in to maintain law and order following the unruly behaviour of the applicants, who became restive over the inability of the board to release their examination slips.

The students gathered at the Muritala Mohammed Way office of JAMB following announcements that they could collect the details of their examination centres from the board.

Our correspondent gathered that the students were asked by JAMB officials to leave their slips and come later to collect their details.

It was learnt that the authorities were overwhelmed by the number of students, who converged on the office, coupled with the slow pace of processing of the information.

The students were said to have become restive when their examination details appeared not to be in sight.

In the confusion that ensued, the officials closed their offices and asked the candidates to come back on Thursday.

At this juncture, the applicants we said to have started smashing doors and windows of the offices.

The policemen were said to have fired gunshots in the air to disperse the candidates.

One of the candidates, who identified herself as Kemi, expressed dismay at the development, saying the officials were endangering the applicants’ lives.

No fewer than three persons are feared dead after supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party and the Labour Party clashed during a political rally in Ekori, Yakurr Local Government Area of Cross River State.

The clash, according to an eyewitness, Ephraim Nya, started on Monday afternoon when youths loyal to PDP tried to disrupt the campaign train of the LP candidate for the Yakurr/Abi Federal Constituency, Dr. Alex Egbona.

Egbona, who was the immediate past Chief of Staff to Governor Liyel Imoke, was scheduled to visit Ekori as part of his campaign tour to solicit for votes for the March 28 election but was barred by youths from entering the community.

Ekori is the hometown of the incumbent House of Representatives member, Mr. Bassey Ewa, who is seeking re-election for the third time under the platform of the PDP.

Our correspondent learnt on Wednesday that the planned visit of Egbona allegedly angered some youths in the area that were said to have barricaded the road leading to the community.

Nya said the action infuriated the LP supporters who resisted their PDP counterpart.

He said, “The fight went on throughout Monday night and the early hours of Tuesday leading to the death of some persons, while several others sustained various degrees of injury. As I speak to you, three people have died and many people have been wounded.

“People have deserted the village and those remaining are the people who are stranded because they don’t have where to go or money to facilitate their movement.”

When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Office, Mr. Hogan Bassey, declined comments but the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Yakurr Division, Mr. Kabiru Salisu, confirmed the incident, but did not confirm the number of deaths.

He said, “Many people sustained injuries in the fight but the situation has been contained by our men.”"

THE Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State said on Sunday that two of its leaders in Akuku-Toru were shot dead by supporters of the All Progressives Congress.

The victims were identified as Mr Ibima Olunta, PDP Chairman Ward 2 Abonnema and Mr Goodfellow Bobmanuel, a PDP councillorship aspirant, ward 2 Abonnema, were killed at the front of their houses.

State Chairman of the PDP, Chief Felix Obuah, who condemned the murder of members of his party, called for the arrest and prosecution of the Caretaker Committee Chairman of Akuku-Toru Local Government Area, Fenibo Jack.

They were shot dead as they sat in front of their house in Abonnema, Ward 2, Akuku-Toru Local Government Area.

Obuah, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser, Media, Mr. Jerry Needam, criticised the reign of terror against PDP members by the APC government of Governor Rotimi Amaechi in Rivers State.

“The PDP accuses the outgoing Governor of Rivers State, Rotimi Amaechi of using tax payers’ money meant for the development of the State to buy arms for youths ahead of the general elections,” the state party chairman said.

Obuah, however, expressed regret that governance in the State had collapsed under Amaechi, adding that ongoing projects have been abandoned while money was diverted to fund the APC and buy arms for youths.

The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, confirmed the killing of two persons on Saturday in Abonnema and added that they (police) were alerted over a gun duel involving cultists.

Mohammad explained that while one person was found dead, the second person who was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died.

“Our men at Abonnema were alerted of the ongoing shootings involving cultists. They (police), on arrival at the scene found one dead, took another injured to the hospital who later died,” he said.

He added that investigation into the matter was going, assuring that the police would unravel those behind the heinous act.

Efforts made by our correspondent to reach the new CTC chairman of Akuku-Toru to react to the allegation against him was futile as several calls and a text message to his mobile phone were not replied."

This came barely a week after the law enforcement agents killed a notorious armed robbery suspect popularly known as Orimeji in Ado Ekiti.

The police said the two robbers were killed along Ikere-Ilawe-Igbara Odo axis during a gun duel with men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS.

Ekiti police spokesman, Alberto Adeyemi, while displaying the corpses at the command headquarters, said one of the deceased was identified as Sunday Ojo. Ojo last year escaped from police net to later form a group that had been terrorising residents in recent time.

According to him, Ojo was notorious for attacking articulated vehicles in the axis, diverting their contents for sale in neighbouring states and at times killing the drivers.

Adeyemi said weapons found on the robbers included a Russian style single- barrel pump action, 25 cartridges, some provisions and small amount of money.

He said: “The SARS operatives were on routine patrol early this morning around 1.45 a.m. along Igbara Odo-Ilawe-Ikere axis. They saw a Volkswagen car and stopped it for a search, but the occupants jumped down and started firing. The two ran into the bush while the others engaged the police in a gun duel.

“The police were able to overpower them, as two of them were shot on the spot and died. Their corpses were brought to headquarters.”

The police spokesperson warned landlords in the state to always be cautious on tenants they take in, and ensure they know their means of livelihood, to forestall harbouring robbers."

A student of the University of Lagos, UNILAG, Akoka, was killed on Tuesday night in a violent clash involving members of rival cult groups on the campus. The identity of the student and his assailants were still unknown as at press time yesterday.

National Mirror gathered that the incident took place around 10pm in front of the university’s amphitheatre, where the killers trailed their victim.

Some students on condition of anonymity told National Mirror that the loud noise of gunshots during the incident made residents and non-residents on campus to take to their heels.

Many linked the incident to the ongoing students’ union election on campus, while others viewed it as battle for supremacy between cult groups on campus.

But the university authorities have denied the victim was a student of the school.

The varsity spokesman, Oke Olagoke, while confirming the incident, told National Mirror that there was no evidence to prove the victim was a UNILAG student and that no one had shown up to claim his body.

He also refuted the claim that the incident was connected with students’ union election, saying the election in the university is now through Electoral College unlike before when all students directly poll to elect their leaders.

Olagoke said though efforts to trace the killers’ whereabouts were on, no arrest had however been made so far in connection with the incident."

The bomb blasts sent hundreds of anxious voters scampering for safety, even as they called to question the ability of the security agencies to prevent such occurrences, especially with the much publicised tight security deployment for the elections.

According to reports from Enugu, the Enugu State capital, some eligible voters and electoral officials were already gathered at the WTC Primary School polling station, waiting for accreditation to commence when the bomb went off around 7.45 am.

The explosion, caused a major a stampede everyone in the polling unit, including the electoral officials, took to their heels.

The sound of the explosion attracted policemen who were nearby and they immediately alerted the Police Headquarters in Enugu.

On arrival, the men of the anti-bomb unit detected two other timed Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in a Honda Car parked within the premises.

The car was evacuated to a safe distance, where the two improvised devices were impaired through controlled detonation.

But, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Istifanus Dafwang, who confirmed the incident, said the lady was a polling officer in Oju LGA of the state.

According to him, ""The girl is an ad hoc staff and a Polling Officer. She died this (Saturday) morning while on her way to the polling unit from motorbike accident. The Okada man is however in the hospital"".

He stated that he was still expecting the particulars of the deceased from the Supervisor in charge of Oju to enable him contact her family.

However, Saturday's election in Anambra State was delayed for several hours following the confusion over the working of the card reader.

Although election materials arrived as early as 8.30 am in many polling units, the card reader did not work, so, the election officials waited for directive from te INEC headquarters.

When Sunday Independent asked the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Edwin Ofor Nwatalari, for comments, he replied in a text message, saying: ""We have them in every polling unit. Is it not the card readers that the whole state is crying about their failure"".

It was learnt, however, that the card readers came with an unformatted sim card. It was only when the electoral officers used their own sim cards that they were advised in line with that, that the election began

It was a different story at the headquarters of Ogbaru local government where drivers carrying election materials refused to leave the secretariat until they were paid. So, as at 1.pm, election did not take place.

At Nri ward 1, polling unit of Uche Ekwunife, who is the incumbent House of Representatives member representing Njikoka/Anaocha/Dunukofia/Idemili zone, INEC officials did not arrive until about 11.45am

In an interview with Ekwunife, she said that the card reader process was so cumbersome, hence they resorted to manual process of accreditation to get the voting process in motion and save time.

Also, the member representing Anambra Central at the National Assembly, Chris Ngige, expressed his disappointment at the process the accreditation process, saying that the card readers were not working, hence the INEC officials resorted to the manual process.

He said: ""I am not happy the way things are going here, the card readers are not working and the officials are resorting to using manual process. ""The Electoral Act stipulated that anywhere manual process is used, the election will be cancelled. So, what it means is that the election here may be cancelled. I am not happy at all"".

Similarly, in Agulu, Aguluzigbo, and Ogbaru local government areas, voting could not commence by 3.pm.

Addressing journalists separately, the former governor of Anmabra State, Peter Obi, and the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) National Chairman, Victor Umeh, expressed dissatisfaction with the card reader system and called for improvement."

A Youth leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was on Saturday allegedly clubbed to death and his body set ablaze by suspected hoodlums in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State during Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections.

The youth leader, Igie Osayande, was allegedly killed by hoodlums when they invaded Ward 9, Units 9, 10 and 11 in Obagienevbosa Community, off Sapele Road, in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area.

An eye-witness in Ward Unit 11, Sunny Osagiede, said the hoodlums stormed the area demanding to be accredited long after it had closed and voting commenced.

Osagiede said when the hoodlums prevailed to get accreditation the policeman on duty ordered them to leave the area.

Osagiede said the trouble escalated when the leader returned with his boys and tore the ballot papers.

“In an attempt to resist them, the youth leader was attacked by the hoodlums who clubbed him to death and also set him ablaze.

He said the body of the deceased had been deposited at a morgue.

Also in Ondo State, an officer of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) narrowly escaped being lynched by youths in Idanre, Idanre Council Area on Sunday over allegation of tampering with the original result sheet for polls in the area.

Crisis erupted in the town earlier in the day when the youths insisted on setting the collation officer ablaze before security men arrested the situation.

It was alleged that the officer was trying to tamper with the original result sheet that was submitted to him after the voting when the youth accosted him.

The state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Segun Agbaje, who later addressed newsmen in his office in Akure, over the incident, disclosed that the affected collation officer had been handed over to the police.

Agbaje said the officer had been taken to the police headquarters along Igbatoro road in Akure for interrogation over the alleged mutilation of collation forms in Idanre.

He said the allegations were being investigated by the police while the affected officer had been arrested and detained by the police.

He, however, assured the people of the state that the collation process would not be manipulated, saying no local government area has completed its compilation as at the time of filing this report.

Anxious politicians and newsmen had earlier gathered at the St. Peter Unity Secondary School, Akure, the Coalition Centre for the Central Senatorial District of the state where coalition of results from the six council areas of Akure South, Akure North, Idanre, Ifedore, Ondo West and Ondo East, were still going on.

In another development, the Bayelsa State Commissioner of Police, Paul Okafor, has confirmed snatching of a ballot box by some thugs at a polling unit in Opolo area of Yenagoa during the Presidential and National Assembly polls.

Okafor who confirmed the incident on Sunday in an interview with newsmen at the council secretariat of Yenagoa Local Government, the collation centre for the area, however, said there were conflicting reports as to whether the thugs were supporters of PDP or the APC.

PDP’s senatorial candidate seeking a third-term at the National Assembly, Senator Emmanuel Paulker, representing Bayelsa Central, hails from Opolo community.

APC’s senatorial candidate, Preye Aganaba, an indigene of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area, also in the senatorial district, is Paulker’s opponent in the National Assembly election.

Okafor said the ballot box did not contain sensitive materials.

He said an intervention team of policemen nearby promptly arrested the situation and recovered the ballot box from the thugs.

He said no arrests were made instantly but that the ringleaders had been identified and would be apprehended soon.

However, the police commissioner described the conduct of the elections as peaceful across the state apart from the issues of late arrival of materials in some far-flung local government areas.

He said the state police command had deployed officers and men in line with its security strategy for the elections.

And in Anambra State, there was heavy shooting on Saturday at the Ihiala Local Government Headquarters following a fight that ensued between the Peoples Democratic Party and All Progressives Grand Alliance chieftains, Ifeanyi Ubah and Ernest Obiejesi alias (Obijackson) repectively.

Reports also had it that the Ihiala local government headquarters may have been set ablaze. Before the gun battle some ward results in the area had been cancelled by the INEC because of irregularities.

During the fracas that ensued, irate youths of the two parties were burning tyres along the Onitsha-Owerri express road, making the place impassable.

People were scampering for safety as security operatives got involved in the shooting to disperse them.

The Public Relations Officer for Anambra INEC, Frank Egbo, however, said he was not aware of the cancellation of the results.

Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State has called for the cancellation of election results in Ogbaru Federal Constituency in the state which took place on Saturday.

In a statement in Awka on Sunday signed by the party’s state Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife, said they were disappointed that during the election, there were no result sheets throughout the state.

“We are quick to warn that Anambra State cannot continue to be a laboratory for election perversion, as it is a fact that the card reader is working in virtually every other state.

“We call on INEC to cancel the elections in all areas of Anambra State where the card reader did not work as the card reader forms part of the accreditation process that some states should not enjoy to the exclusion of others,” Madukaife stated."

Nigerian troops have engaged Boko Haram insurgents in fierce battle in Dungulbe village in Bauchi State.

A security source who did not want his name in print said on Sunday that fighter jets were sent to help them to defeat the hoodlums.

“The fighter jets are pounding the hoodlums while ground troops are engaging them,” he said.

Consequently, the state government has imposed a 24-hour curfew in three local government areas of the state indefinitely.

The LG are Bauchi, Alkaleri and Kiri.

Deputy Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mallam Danlami Baban Takko, said: “The curfew was as a result of the ongoing battle between soldiers and Boko Haram fighters.”

He said the curfew was imposed to enable security agencies to restore normalcy in the area as part of government’s effort to protect lives and property.

However, the Governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the April 11 election, Mohammed Abubakar, has kicked against the curfew imposed by the state government.

Abubakar alleged that it was a plan by the ruling party to scuttle the results of the Presidential and National Assembly election which the APC claimed it was already winning with the results that were so far released across the state.

He described the imposition of the curfew as an attempt by the government to tamper with Saturday’s votes.

He thereby called on the people of the state to come out and protect their votes as they freely expressed on Saturday.

The attacks on Alkaleri and Kirfi Local Government Areas of Bauchi State by the insurgent group caused tensions in Bauchi, the state capital.

There were rumours in Bauchi that the sect members had entered Bauchi metropolis, causing panic among residents, while the few people who came out to vote hurriedly returned home to avoid being caught in any cross fire."

Bauchi State Police Command spokesman, DSP Mohammed Haruna, confirmed the attack, saying the hoodlums stormed Tafawa-Balewa in a convoy of 18 vehicles and started shooting sporadically.

Haruna added that security and vigilante groups engaged the hoodlums in fierce battle and the insurgents abandoned four Hilux vehicles with anti-aircraft machine guns and retreated to Bununu after suffering heavy casualties.

Crisis returned to Ekiti State on Wednesday as gunmen attacked the All Progressives Congress Secretariat and jubilant members of the party.

The APC members had just returned from the streets of Ado Ekiti where they had gone to celebrate the victory of the APC candidate, Maj. Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in the Saturday’s Presidential election.

The state Publicity Secretary, Taiwo Olatubosun, who addressed journalists in Ado Ekiti after the attack, said the gunmen came in three Hilux vans with Government House number plates with three men in Police uniform sitting in the front.

Accusing Governor Ayodele Fayose and the Police of complicity in the attack, he said the party had earlier got information that plan was being hatched by some top officials in the government house to prevent any celebration in the state.

He alleged that the gunmen were members of a killer gang sent to disrupt the APC victory party by the governor.

But Fayose said the attack was a self-sponsored attack by the APC to make it look like an attack from outside, urging the people to disregard the allegations.

Olatubosun wondered why the hoodlums attacked the Secretariat unchallenged in the presence of a detachment of police led by the Divisional Police Officer of the Ologede Police Station, Ado Ekiti, that had provided security for the victory party.

According to him, the gunmen brandishing guns, cutlasses and axes, rained bullets on the secretariat and destroyed no fewer than five cars parked at the secretariat.

Olatunbosun mentioned Femi Ogunleye (aka Akilapa), Basiru Ajagbe, Ayo Terrorist and Opeyemi Atiaro as the leaders of the attack.

The intensity of the attack, he said, forced party members and passers-by to scamper for safety.

“We had few members left when they came because some of our teeming members who held a peaceful victory procession were already leaving before they came. They shot at our secretariat.

“We were aware that they were coming but we never knew Governor Fayose could do anything funny because of the mood of the nation, though, we heard him boasting that he won’t allow anyone to mark the victory of Buhari in Ekiti State,” he said.

But the Commissioner of Police, Taiwo Lakanu, while denying that Police supervised the attack said the timely response of his men led by the Area Commander saved the situation.

“We received information that there was an attack on APC secretariat and I deployed a team there led by Area Commander. They succeded in flushing out the miscreants.

“We are still making effort to arrest the miscreants. We have information on those who perpetrated the act. Our timely arrival scared away the miscreants. I am telling you categorically that my men will never be involved. That is a mere exaggeration. Ologede DPO was not there.”

Reacting, Fayose through his Chief Press Secretary, Idowu Adelusi, in a statement said he did not send anybody to attack the APC and had never done such a thing in the past.

The statement read, “The APC in their usual character have piled up strategies and as well more than 20 lies of various‎ degrees which they had planned to execute on daily basis to cause commotion in the state if General Buhari wins the election.

“One of such lies is this allegation of attack which in actual sense they planned and executed by themselves to make it look as if they were attacked by outsiders.

“The Governor does not operate or have any killer gang as they had alleged, rather, it is the APC’s killer gang which was set up and funded by Fayemi’s administration and headed by Deji Adesokan that has reappeared again in the state, and we are urging the police to be on their trail before they wreck havoc.

“This killer gang which killed not less than 10 people when Fayemi was in government, relocated outside the state after that ‎administration was ousted. Ekiti state has been peaceful since then. We are aware of their sinister plans to ‎ cause crisis in the state and they have started by invading the State House of Assembly today.”

It further said, “If the APC is sure of the attack, it should report that to the police. We are again informing Ekiti people of the evil plans by the APC to plunge the state into another crisis and stand up to defend this government, defend the mandate you have freely given to Ayo Fayose."

Dare devil armed robbers in the early hours of Wednesday stormed Iju-Ishaga, a Lagos Suburb in Ifako Ijaiye Local Government Area, killing a member of O’odua People Congress, (OPC) who served as a security guard in the community.

The robbers were however repelled by the anti robbery police men from Iju Police Division, (Red House) who arrested two of them while others escaped through the swampy canal.

The police recovered two locally made guns, cartridges, charms, identity cards, ATM cards and substances suspected to be Indian hemp.

Lagos State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Kenneth Nwosu who confirmed the arrest said that the suspects were immediately transferred to the Special Anti Robbery Squad SARS at the headquarters of the command with the exhibits recovered from the robbers.

Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Kayode Aderanti has ordered the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) to commence full scale investigation into the robbery attack and arrest other fleeing members of the gang.

An eye witness, Evangelist Elija Umoh who is secretary, Community Development Association (CDA), Alade Olowosokedile, Iju Ishaga said the robbers numbering about 20 touched the four streets that made up the community namely Nelson Cole, Iyabo Williams, Alafia and Hope streets adding that the guard simply identify as Mathew was hacked to death with clubs and heavy stone at Alafia Street as the bullets expended from their guns could not penetrate him.

He said that the robbers broke into virtually all the houses scaling through the fences but did not succeed in removing any property both in monetary and materials due to the prompt arrival of the police and other security guards in the area.

He said: “It started at about 2am on Wednesday, I received a call from my tenant that he was hearing some noise in the area and that he suspected armed robbers were operating, so I raised an alarm and called my CDA Chairman and the security operatives within the area. The Chief security of the area said they were up to twenty-two in number. They were moving from house to house, but when they discovered that the security men were all over, they started looking for escape route. Unfortunately, one of the night guards, Mathew lost his life in the process, he is an OPC member that we use in securing the area. They hacked him with a stone after they shot him and did not succeed in killing him with gun.

They went into many houses but did not succeed because they were repelled. This is not the first time this is happening to this community. It happened two years ago when we also lost a resident, Land lord in the process.”

The CDA scribe appreciated the effort of the police saying that they always respond each time they call them but urged them to do more and increase the level of monitoring and patrol of the area.

Umoh also urged the Lagos State Government to do something about the abandoned project behind the community which he said has become a hiding place and safe haven for criminals.

“The pitch behind the community where the state government owned a property that has been abandoned for several years has been a kind of security threat to the community because whenever the hoodlums want to operate, they came through this avenue and exit through the same place. The government should secure it better than it is even if they did not want to revive the project so that we can be secured."

*Five PDP chieftains, others kidnapped.



segun James in Yenagoa.

Barely 24 hours to Saturday's governorship and state assembly elections, suspected pirates have attacked a passenger boat conveying five aides to the Deputy Speaker of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Chief Sam Ateki along the waterways of Brass in Brass Local Government Area of the State. The whereabouts of the men is still unknown as at press time.

However, while two other boats were successfully attacked and their passengers abducted, the boat conveying the State Chairman of the Nigerian Union Journalists (NUJ), Comrade Tare Akonno escaped pirates due to quick information from a woman fishing in the area.

The victims of the attack and the aides of the Deputy Speaker were heading to Twon Brass to participate in today's State House of Assembly election! When the attack took place.

The Brass axis of the Bayelsa waterways is notorious for pirate activities and the den for all types of criminal activities including crude oil theft, illegal bunkering and illegal refining of crude oil.

""The pirates were heavily armed and shot sporadically to scare the boat driver. The boat was filled with passengers made up of members of the Twon Brass PDP and aides to the Deputy Speaker,"" an eyewitness who escaped the attack told newsmen on Friday.

Although it could not be confirmed if the attack was political, THISDAY gathered that men of the Nigerian Armed Forces have, under the auspices of the Joint Task Force (JTF) Operation Pulo Shield, promised to patrol the waterways so that the people can go home to rural communities to exercise their franchise.

Comrade Akonno who confirmed that the boat conveying him to Brass escaped narrowly due to the quick alert from a fisher woman along the troubled waters, said: ""When she saw our boat moving to the site of the attack, she quickly informed us and we turned back and hid at Okoroma community until after the pirates' operation.""

Contacted, the State Police Command's spokesperson, ASP Asinim Butswat confirmed the attack on the passenger boats, but denied that the PDP chieftains were abducted.

""Yes, it was a case of piracy attack, but no life was lost. The pirates only dispossessed their victims of mobile phones, cash and other personal effects. They were not kidnapped and were coming from the Brass."""

Five persons have been feared killed in Akwa Ibom State during the governorship and state House of Assembly elections on Saturday.

A reporter with one of the local tabloids, Radar Newspaper, Mr. Aniedi Ukoenang’s whereabouts is unknown.

The killings occurred at Ward 5, Unit 14, Mbiabong Etoi and Shelter Afrique (Uyo); Ndiya in Nsit Ubium; Etim Ekpo, and Ini Local Government Areas of the state.

The reporter was said to have been abducted by the Peoples Democratic Party thugs at Ekpeyong Ufum village, Odoro Ikot clan in Essien Udim LGA.

The decision by the party to call for the boycott and cancellation of the elections followed a reported widespread hijack of electoral materials by thugs and armed fake policemen, suspected to be sponsored by the Peoples Democratic Party.

Our correspondents, who went round Uyo, Etinan, Onna, Eket, Nsit Ubium, the five local government areas of Oro, Uruan, Ibiono, Nsit Ibom, Oruknam, among others, report that ballot box diversion, thump printing of ballot papers, characterised the April 11 elections in Akwa Ibom State.

It was also learnt that many centres were denied electoral materials. And in the areas, where they were provided, the figures would not tally with the number of accredited voters.

At Uda Ward 2, Unit 2, Unyenge in Mbo LGA, an INEC ad-hoc worker allegedly hid in the bush when indigenes discovered that he tore the fake result sheets he gave to villagers as he tried to replace the thump printed with original ones.

An indigene, Mfoniso Ekpimah, who spoke with our correspondents, explained that the youths of the area seized the ballot box, tore all the electoral papers and seized the card readers while the INEC ad-hoc worker escaped to an unknown destination in the bush.

The APC governorship candidate in the state, Mr. Umana Umana, said out of 1,571 registered voters, only 450 ballot papers were sent to his polling unit.

He stated that for a long time, voting materials were not brought to his unit and in all the other units in Nsit Ubium LGA.

Umana stated that he received a report that materials had been diverted to the residence of Senator Effiong Bob.

He noted that the action was violently done by thugs, who assaulted agents and INEC officials on their way to deliver the election materials."

Angry youths in Bogoro, Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi State allegedly beat a councillor from Gizaki/Badagari Ward, Mr. Musa Daniel, to death during Saturday’s elections.

The Chairperson of the Caretaker Committee of Bogoro LGA, Mrs. Hassana Arkila, broke the news to newsmen shortly after casting her vote.

Arkila described the incident as unfortunate, saying it was the handiwork of enemies of the country’s democracy.

“I have just been informed that one of my councillors on lawful duty has been beaten to death by irate youths. I am assuring you that the full wrath of the law will catch up with the attackers,” she said.

The council boss urged the people of the local government to sheath their swords and embrace peace, adding that violence was not the solution to political differences.

According to Arkila the action of the youths was an indication that the opposition was jittery of defeat and called for calm among PDP supporters in the area.

When our correspondent called the Public Relations Officer, Bauchi State Police Command, Haruna Mohammed, to confirm the incident, he said he was not aware of it.

“I am not aware of such an incident but I will confirm it later,” he said.

Nigerians went back to the polls on Saturday for state elections.

Violence and voter apathy characterised the gubernatorial and National Assembly elections held across the country yesterday.

It was a straight fight between the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the federal level and the opposition All Progressives Party (APC) whose candidate, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), won the March 28 presidential election.

In yesterday's elections, violence rocked at least seven states across the country leading to 16 deaths.

Five persons were feared killed in Benue; four in Kebbi; two, each, in Rivers and Lagos; and one, each, in Plateau, Bauchi and Ebonyi.

President Goodluck Jonathan blamed the low turnout in his native Bayelsa on the non-holding of the gubernatorial election in the state.

Only the House of Assembly election took place in the state.

The European Union Chief Observer to the elections, Santiago Fisas, also lament the poor voter turnout at the polls.

As the results of the elections began to trickle in, last night, reports said Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti won 25 of the 26 legislative seats in the state assembly for his party, the PDP, leaving one seat for Labour Party (LP).

Only the legislative election held in Ekiti.

Meanwhile, Governor Rotimi Amaechi faulted the conduct of the elections in Rivers State, describing it as a sham.

He also alleged that his phone number was claimed by some people to send text messages to APC supporters to ask them to ask to boycott the polls, saying it was a ploy to give advantage to the PDP in the elections.

The gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Rivers State, Mr Nyesom Wiki, immediately countered Amaechi, saying all was well with the polls in the state.

Benue: monarch, four others killed

In Benue State, the district head of Utange in Ushongo local government area, Zaki Joseph Kumbur, and four others were reported to have been killed, before and during the elections apparently marred by low turn out of voters.

This came just as INEC offices in Tarka and Ushongo local government areas were said to have been attacked by suspected hoodlums who also snatched ballot boxes in several polling units around Makurdi, the state capital, and in parts of the state in the wave of crisis and violence that affected the polls in the state.

The breakdown of the reported killings showed that two persons were shot dead in Zaki-Biam in Ukum local government area, one gunned down at the North Bank area of Makurdi and another killed in Gwer local government area.

""A young man, who was a kingpin in North Bank, also popularly known as 'Almighty', was shot in the head following disagreement with members of his gang over sharing of money"", a source said.

""In Zaki-Biam, there was sporadic shooting in the main town on the eve of the election. Two persons were discovered dead today (Saturday).

""In Gwer, a medical practitioner (names withheld) was reported to have been arrested over the alleged killing of a voter who he allegedly stabbed to death after a heated argument.""

Sunday Vanguard learnt that the Utange district head, Kumbur, was killed, Friday night in his residence by unknown armed men who stormed the place in a commando fashion.

""His death may not be unconnected with the wave of political disagreements that have characterized elections in that part of the state"", said our source.

When contacted, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ozi Obih said, the Zaki-Biam incident was a political stampede while the North Bank shooting was as a result of disagreement among friends but added that he was yet to get the confirmation of deaths.

Kebbi: Four feared killed by soldiers

In Kebbi State, soldiers allegedly killed four voters in Bayan Dutse Polling Unit, Ginga Ward in Suru Local Government Area.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident to journalists.

""Yes, we have received report of four people allegedly killed by soldiers. I will give you details of the killings as soon we conclude our investigation,"" he said.

The House of Representative member-elect, representing Suru/Bagudo federal constituency, Abdullahi Suru, also confirmed this to journalists.

He said the incident happened around noon, yesterday, as accreditation was going on in the area, which predominantly has supporters of the APC.

""A serving Area Development councillor, Ahmed Sankezu, invited the soldiers to arrest some prominent elders in the area because he was earlier prevented from accessing the PU to perfect their rigging plan"", he added.

The Army Headquarters said it didn't have information on the incident yet.

In Ebonyi State, the Chairman of the PDP in Ishielu Local Government Area, Emeka Nworie, was reportedly killed by suspected political thugs in the early hours of yesterday.

Police spokesperson, Chris Anyanwu, confirmed to Channels Television that Nworie was attacked in his house in Ezzagu where he was shot several times.

According to Anyanwu, the incident took place around 3am. He said the attackers had asked for money from their victim, which was given to them, after which they still went ahead to kill him.

The State has had its share of political violence in the run-up to the general elections. Only recently, two people were killed in Ikwo following a clash between the supporters of the PDP and Labour Party.

Lagos: 2 corpses linked to polls

In Lagos State, the governorship and legislative elections were marred by apathy in most areas despite the significant improvement in logistic management for the polls.

Two corpses found in Oshodi and along Apapa - Oshodi Road were also linked to the polls.The accreditation and voting processes were most uneventfully in many polling stations. There were no incidents or problems with the card reader and queues were absent as people went home after accreditation and came back to vote in the afternoon.

However, leaders of the two major parties in the state, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC and Chief Bode George of the PDP, in separate interviews, alleged conspiracies directed against their parties.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, REC, Mr. Akin Orebiyi, however, washed the INEC from all such allegations, saying the conduct of yesterday's polls was a significant improvement on the presidential and National Assembly elections. According to him, the commission was able to come out with the improvements after internal deliberations.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at about 1.45 p.m. at Polling Unit 047, Sunday Adigun Street, Alausa, Ikeja, Tinubu flayed what he described as the deliberate attempt to intimidate voters against the APC.

""Throughout the week before the election, there were lots of gunshots across the state. That is scary to the people and that is why they didn't even come out. That is the method of rigging,"" he said.

APC leader also alleged that the PDP-led Federal Government relegated the Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP, Mr. Kayode Aderanti, to the level of an area commander to enable it perfect it's plan to compromise the elections.

According to him, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Joseph Mbu, took over the commissioner's functions.

He, however, commended the improvement in the conduct of the elections as compared with the presidential and National Assembly polls two weeks ago.

The assertions of manipulations were, however, dismissed by Lagos PDP leader, Chief Bode George. Speaking to Sunday Vanguard shortly after voting at Evans Street, George described Tinubu's allegations as laughable.

He said: ""Who said it? Is it Bola or their noise maker? If it is their noise maker, he is from another planet. They wanted the government and they have gotten it. You cannot continuously be lying to yourself. We are trying to rig, with whom and for what? 16 years, they stayed on the saddle here in Lagos, what is the outcome? The people say they are tired of the APC and they are hounding them out of the system. The APC says we want to rig, let them say that to the marines, they are clowns"".

The accusation was also dismissed by the Chairman of the PDP in the state, Mr. Tunji Shelle.

The Minister of State for foreign affairs, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, on his part, accused the APC of waging a war of intimidation against PDP supporters.

When asked if the alleged intimidation was responsible for the voter apathy, he said ""it could be.""

His words: ""Don't forget that some sections of our soceity were threatened with death. To that extent, we have to take stock of what transpired in Lagos. From the feedback, it could be responsible.""

Governor Babatunde Fashola refused to be dragged into arguments on the cause of the apathy by voters. He, however, expressed his optimism that the APC governorship candidate, Akinwunmi Ambode, would win the polls.

""I am always optimistic of any contest. I am optimistic Ambode will emerge the winner,"" the governor said after voting in Surulere.

His deputy, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, told Sunday Vanguard at her polling unit at Egbeda Round-About in Alimosho that voters thought the presidential election was more important than the governorship.

She also pointed at improvements in the functionality of the card reader and other logistics.

The Deputy Governor, however, dismissed the allegation that many non-indigenes did not turn out because of the threat by the Oba of Lagos.

""He was not a politician or an APC member. Besides, that issue was resolved before the election. I think that basically, people wanted change at the centre and that was why they came out en-masse to vote during the last election. They must have already concluded that continuity be sustained at the state level"", she added.

The PDP governorship candidate in the state, Mr Jimi Agbaje, had, at the beginning of the day, expressed concern on the apathy by voters. Agbaje spoke to newsmen when he did his accreditation at Ward 2 Polling Unit 009, Duala/Abraham Adesanya Street, Apapa.

Police commissioner parades Lagos

The Lagos Police Commissioner, Aderanti, yesterday, paraded Lagos during the elections, spending time around Alimosho and arresting vehicles that were not on special duty that dared to come out.

Financial inducement/refreshments

Sunday Vanguard observed some refreshments in certain centres during the accreditation process and voters alleged some youths came out and shared money to voters on voting grounds. Some voters collected the money and some turned it down. In the same vein, some voters collected the refreshments and some turned them down according to our sources. One source said,"" I cannot be bought with money. This is one decision I have taken upon myself and nobody will swing my votes to favour his candidate. I didn't take their money. And I didn't take any refreshment from them. Am I a hungry man to be swayed by a bottle of La Casera and doughnut?""

Rivers: Deaths amid heavy shootings

In Rivers State, heavy shooting was reported in Ozuoba and Rumuolumeni in Obio Akpor Local Government Area.

Soldiers moved into Buguma in Asari Toru LGA where two persons were feared dead, also amid heavy shooting allegedly by political thugs. A police patrol vehicle, the house of the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Joeba West, and INEC polling centre in Kalabari National College in the town were razed by unknown arsonists.

It was learnt that about 80 per cent of the card readers deployed in Okrika were not working.

Wike and Peterside

Failure of card readers on massive scale was also reported in Abua Odua LGA where polling officers resorted to Incident Forms.

Meanwhile, Governor Chibuike Amaechi described the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections in the state as a sham, saying they were marred by ballot papers snatching and hijacking of other sensitive materials of INEC.

He also alleged that his phone number was cloned by people who used it to send text messages to APC members in the state not to participate in the elections. Amaechi spoke shortly after he was accredited at his ward in Ubima community in Ikwerre local government area. His wife was also accredited.

Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. David Iyofor, quoted his principal as saying the election was a failed exercise going by reports available to him from several parts of Rivers.

""From what we saw on our way to Ubima and reports we got from across the state, it is unfortunate this can happen"", he said. In a related development, the leader of APC in Obio Akpor LGA, Chief Tony Okocha, alleged that result sheets for nine wards in the local government were missing.

According to him, they were replaced with cloned result sheets.

Continuing, he said he had directed members of the party to only vote when they see authentic result sheets, adding that he had also complained to the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dame Gecilia Khan.

""Our people will go and vote but they should counter sign result sheets if we must vote.

Result sheets for Wards 9, 10, 11,17,13,8,2 and12 are missing"", the APC leader stated.

""I have sent text messages to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Gecilia Khan, and Professor Olurinde, sent by the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Atahiru Jega.

""These are th e results we know that have been taking. They replaced them with cloned results. We are ready for the elections. But the REC should counter sign the result sheets"".

The PDP candidate in the gubernatorial election in Rivers State, Mr. Nyesom Wike, hails from Obio Akpor LGA.

About 50 heavily armed soldiers mounted heavy blockade around the family residence of the governorship candidate.

Vehicles were thoroughly searched before being allowed to drive through Wipey Junction, a very busy intersection close to the family residence.

At about 6.40am, the soldiers were emptying sand bags from one of their trucks.

Pedestrians were seen raising their hands as they walked past the soldiers who took strategic positions with their rifles.

Wike dismissed the claim by Amaechi that the elections were a sham.

The gubernatorial candidate, who said the governor should not be taken seriously, urged politicians in Rivers to emulate Jonathan who conceded defeat in the presidential election.

""Which election has he (Amaechi) not described as a sham? He dismissed the presidential election as a sham but when Buhari won, did he not say it was an act of God?"", he said.

He accused the governor of allegedly going round some wards in Obio Akpor local government area, adding that he disrupted the election in Ward 12.

Wike also said INEC had postponed elections in Wards 15 and 16 in the local government area.

Some voters reportedly protested against the presence of Amaechi in some wards in Omagwa in Ikwerre local government area, saying he should go to Ubima where he registered.

The governorship candidate of the APC in the state, Dr Dakuku Peterside, said accreditation for the election went on smoothly in his Opobo community at the time he spoke to newsmen.

He, however, alleged that about seven members of his party were killed in Ogba Egbema Ndoni local government area. This, however, could not be confirmed from the police at press time.

He also alleged that materials were hijacked in several parts of the state.

Senator Magnus Abe, who represents Rivers South-East in the Senate, made similar allegations about Gokhana, saying the elections did not hold there.

Minister of State for Industry, Chief Kenneth Kobani, countered Abe, maintaining that the elections went on smoothly in several areas of Gokhana local government area.

Plateau: Party supporter shot dead

In Plateau State, voting was nearly marred at the Sarkin Arab Ward and environs when a young man at nearby Ali Kazaure Polling Station in Jos North Local Government Area was shot dead by a security operative.

The deceased was said to be a supporter of one of the political parties and was engaging a supporter of another party in a scuffle before the security personnel standing by intervened to end the quarrel.

In the course of the scuffle, the deceased allegedly drew out a knife but as a soldier tried to take the weapon from him. He was said to have struggled with the soldier and this infuriated the soldier who fired at him.

The timely intervention of other security agents saved the situation and normalcy was restored in the area and elections continued.

Spokesman for the Special Task Force, STF, Capt. Ikedichi Iweha, who confirmed the incident, described it as unfortunate, adding that the man engaged soldiers in a fight when they tried to intervene to prevent him from stabbing his opponent.

Meanwhile, card reader yesterday, for the second time, failed to authenticate Governor Jonah Jang, and his wife, Ngo Talatu, at their Ladura I Polling Unit in Jos South, Local Government Area of the state.

Jang and his wife had to fill incident form for accreditation just like they did during the presidential and National Assembly elections. Speaking with newsmen after filling the incident form, Jang said ""I am impressed with the turnout of citizens.

The exercise was generally peaceful and orderly in polling units monitored in local government areas in Plateau North and Plateau Central zones of the state and officials of the Independent INEC and election materials arrived the various polling units early compared to what was experienced during the March 28, polls.

Turnout was impressive as people were seen being accredited as early as 8am but the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Gyang Pwajok, who spoke with journalists, lamented that his wife and many others were deprived of voting by INEC because of the insistence on permanent voter cards, PVCs.

At the central zone, card readers were generally functioning well as hitches seen during the March, 28 polls were not witnessed in all polling units visited while voters were queuing orderly for accreditation.

Bauchi: Councillor beaten to death

In Bauchi State, the chairperson of Bogoro Local Government Area, Hassana Arkila, confirmed the death of the PDP councilor for Gizaki/Badagari Ward, Mr Musa Daniel, saying he was beaten to death by angry youths while on electoral duty.

Arkila described the attack on the councilor as unfortunate and linked the incident to saboteurs of democracy.

She said :"" I want to confirm the death of a PDP councilor who was beaten to death by irate youths. l am assuring the people of the state that the full wrath of law will catch up with the attackers"".

The chairperson appealed to the perpetrators of the dastardly act to sheath their sword and embrace peace, saying violence is not the solution to political differences.

""The death of the councillor is a signal that the APC is afraid of losing the electoral process. I ask for calm among PDP supporters"", she added.

Meanwhile, voting commenced in some polling units in the state as early as 9.00 am but there was low turn out of voters.

Some of polling units where voting commenced early are El-duniya, Daníyae and Lido Hotel polling units.

The Presiding Officer at El-duniya polling unit, Abba John, said they combined accreditation and voting because of the few numbers of voters.

He said: ""We had fewer numbers of voters unlike the presidential election when we had large turn out.

The electorate and parties agents agreed that voting should commence so that we don't stay idle"".

When asked if their action was right, John said: ""Though it's wrong, INEC told us to give the voters what they want; that is why we agreed to do it"".

The APC and PDP agents at the polling unit, Kingsley Oyenka and Musa Liman, respectively, said they agreed on the early commencement of voting.

As at 10.30 am, 67 people had voted at El-duniya while 37 had cast their votes at Lido.

Meanwhile, the card reader rejected the thumbprint of Governor Mallam Isa Yuguda at Baba Sidi Primary School, Bauchi where he had gone for accreditation for yesterday's polls.

It was a replay of the situation during the presidential and National Assembly elections two weeks ago when the card reader failed to accredit him.

Speaking with journalists after accreditation, yesterday, the governor said, ""So far, so bad, the card has rejected my thumb print again. My thumb print was rejected during presidential and National Assembly elections; the samething happened today again"".

Yuguda commended voters for their orderly conduct at polling units.

On the low turn out of voters, Yuguda said"" some of the electorates believed in the Presidential election so may be that was the reason for the low turn out but I want to urge them to come out and exercise their franchise.

The APC gubernatorial candidate in the polls, Mohammed Abubakar, while speaking with journalist, at Guru Galadima polling unit after accreditation, commended the turn out and orderliness of the voters.

Bayelsa: Jonathan explains poor voter turnout

Reports from Bayelsa State said President Goodluck Jonathan was accredited at about 10.55am at his Otuoke polling unit in an exercise characterised by low voters turnout.

The president was without his wife, Patience.

Unlike the presidential and National Assembly polls where Mr. President was subjected to about 50 minutes wait due to the malfunctioning of card readers, his accreditation, yesterday, took less than a minute.

He later visited his mother, Madam Eunice Jonathan, at her residence, a walking distance from the polling unit.

Jonathan's mother had earlier done her accreditation.

The president, in an interview with newsmen before he retired to his country home after the accreditation, expressed satisfaction with the exercise as, according to him, ""INEC has probably rectified the card reader fault.""

He blamed the poor turn of voters across Bayelsa on the fact that there was no governorship election in the state.

He however expressed hope of PDP victory in the election.

In another development, the state assembly poll in Oruma community in Ogbia council area was marred by alleged hijack of election materials by suspected thugs.

Many eligible were said to have beaten a quick retreat to their homes when the hoodlums stormed the area and carted away election materials.

Ekiti: Voters shun polls

Reports from Ekiti State where only the House of Assembly was holding claimed there was apathy on the part of voters, as the election in different parts of the state witnessed a low turn out.

A visit by our correspondent to Ado, Ikere, Ikole, Afao, Ilawe, Aramoko,Omuo, Isan, Ise and Oye, indicated apathy on the part of the electorate.

At Ise, Ilawe, Ikere, Ayedun and Ijero Ekiti some youths took the opportunity to play foodball at open fields and street roads.

However, the election was generally peaceful. Governor Ayo Fayose and his wife, Feyisetan, voted at Maternity Polling Center, Afao at about 2.02p.m

Fayose said he was satisfied with the conduct of the electorate.

Abia: Complaints galore

In Abia State, the governorship and House of Assembly elections were generally peaceful.

Reports from across the state indicated that INEC deployed materials in time and accreditation also commenced on time.

However, there were complaints from Ofeme and other communities in Ohuhu clan to the effect that the result sheets supplied to the area were fake. The same complaint was received in some communities in Umuahia South council area.

But the INEC Director of Public Education and Enlightenment, Mr. Edwin Enabor, dismissed the allegations. According to him, when the people from Ohuhu came with their complaint, the electoral officers posted to the area were called to bring the materials which he said proved that what they had were genuine INEC materials.

Also, there were areas where card readers did not work and the people reverted to the manual process. This affected areas like Obingwa, Ohafia, Umuahia South.

There was equally reports of alleged hijack of ballot papers at Ihechiowa in Arochukwu council area, World Bank Primary School and Afara Technical School in Umuahia.

Governor Theodore Orji, who voted at 2.10pm in his Ugba Primary School Unit, expressed satisfaction with the turnout of voters and their peaceful conduct and expressed the hope that it would be the same across the state.

Orji also expressed the hope that PDP would win the polls to retain power in the state.

Meanwhile, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Abia, Dr. Alex Otti, has called for the cancellation of the governorship and state assembly elections in the state, alleging that they were fraught with fraud.

Otti alleged while speaking to newsmen in his Umuehim Nvosi, Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area that the elections were marred by armed thugs suspected to be loyal to PDP who allegedly invaded polling units, shot sporadically and snatched ballot boxes.

Kwara: Optimism amid low turnout

In Kwara State, the elections were reportedly marred by low turn out.

Sunday Vanguard's visit to some polling units Ilorin,Idofian, Ipee, Ojoku among others showed low turn out, but Ajase Ipo and Offa maintained active participation of the voters with high turn out.

Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, the APC gubernatorial candidate in the elections, and the leader of the APC in the state, Senator Bukola Saraki, lamented the low turn-out of the elections.

However, the two leaders commended the peaceful conduct of the exercise, which saw voters' turn out later being impressive in the state.

Similarly, Minister of National Planning, Dr. Abubakar Sulaiman, said the voters' apathy was due to what he termed ""the lacklustre attitude of security agencies in the last elections"".

The Minister, who voted in the same polling unit with Saraki, complained of inadequate security presence in the last elections and called on INEC to relocate the three polling units at Ode Opobiyi, saying they were sited in residential areas.

Another APC chieftain, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, who voted at his Baboko Ward, said many Nigerians expect a lot from the incoming administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that they were not that concerned with the state elections.

Also, the Senior Special Adviser to Governor Ahmed on Media and Communications, Dr. Muideen Akorede, who commended the people for the ""impressive turn out,"" told journalists in Offa that his boss would be re-elected at the end of the elections.

But the Director General of the PDP Campaign in Kwara State, Deacon John Dara, said in Ipee, his hometown, that the PDP gubernatorial candidate,Senator Simeon Ajibola Ajibola, will shock book makers and win the election.

Edo: Tight security, Oshiomhole laments card reader hitches

Reports from Edo State said although only the House of Assembly poll held there, there was low voters turn out. The election was held under tight security. Voting materials arrived the entire 18 local government areas between 8:00am and 8:30am.

However, tension was more in Orhionmwon Local Government Council due to the senatorial election result expected from the area. Deputy Governor of the state, Dr Pius Odubu, described the exercise as peaceful but regretted the earlier problem encountered with card readers. Meanwhile, the results of the House of Assembly election trickling in indicated that the APC was winning many seats in the state.

In Ward 5, Ugboko Units 27 and 28, at about 11am, there was a clash between PDP and APC youths after a former Minister of State for Works, Engr. Chris Ogienwonyi, accused a PDP leader in the ward of confiscating over 40 PVCs belonging to some persons.

However, the PDP supporters insisted he should go to his unit, stressing that he was not supposed to be at the unit which they said was not his voting centre. However, APC supporters countered, asserting that a chieftain of the PDP in the state, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who came to the area during the incident was also not supposed to be there.

In Edo Central, suspected thugs invaded some polling units in Ewohinmi and carted away ballot papers. The same situation occurred in Opoji.

Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who voted in his Iyamho ward 10 at about 3:10pm, lamented the failure of the card reader in some areas and urged INEC to fish out the bad eggs frustrating the efforts of the electoral body.

The governor also said there was low voters' turnout because of the frustration they experienced with the card readers.

DELTA: Controversy as soldiers impound commissioner's car

In Delta State, controversy over the enforcement of the no vehicular movement rule on election day marred the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Asaba, the state capital, as soldiers had a running battle with motorists.

The motorists, which included top government officials, were prevented from driving to their polling units by armed soldiers who insisted on enforcing the regulation imposed by the Inspector General of Police, Suleiman Abba, to the letter.

The action of the soldiers, who raided the city, confiscating keys of drivers sent shivers down the spine of voters, as the serenity of the capital city was shattered creating tension and apprehension in the minds of voters who had finished accreditation and waiting for voting which was billed for 1pm.

In the ensuing fracas and for fear of the soldiers, many voters took to their heels as they believed that the action of soldiers could not be predicted.

Many of the cars whose keys were collected by the soldiers were left in the middle of Nnebisi Road, the most popular and busiest road in the state capital. As the raid progressed from the Flyover Bridge, the soldiers arrived at JohnBosco, the polling unit where the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Chike Ogeah, was to cast his votes.

The soldiers attempted to seize the key of the commissioner's car which led to further commotion.

Ogeah, whose attention was drawn to the incident, introduced himself to the soldiers but the soldiers refused to listen to him and insisted on impounding the car.

The commissioner accused the soldiers of scaring voters away with their action.

But a spokesman for the army, who simply identified as Olaleye O., said the seizure of keys from vehicle drivers was an order from the Inspector General of Police that no vehicular movement should be allowed on election day.

""The order of no vehicular movement means no vehicular movement between 8.am and 6pm. It's only security agents and others on essential duties that are supposed to be with their vehicles. The issue of ballot snatching is traceable to movement of vehicles and tricycles on election days"", he stated.

""So while we were going round there was a lot of vehicular movement and we decided to enforce the no vehicular movement order by the IGP. It was announced on the radio and television. People are supposed to walk to their polling units and cast their votes.

""Nobody has collected any PVC from anybody. All we are saying is that your vehicle is not supposed to be on the road"".

Answering a question on distance from residence to polling unit and the fact that there were some vehicular movements during the presidential election, Olaleye said ""we are simply enforcing an order from the Inspector General of Police"".

Ogun: Man with several PVCs held

In Ogun, the state police command arrested a man (names withheld) for unlawful possession of several Permanent Voter Cards in Abeokuta during the governorship and House of Assembly elections.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Muyiwa Adejobi, who confirmed the incident, said the command was investigating the matter.

Also, there were reports of snatching of ballot boxes in various parts of the state.

According to sources, at Westley School, Unit 002, Ward 009, two men absconded after being caught with stolen PVCs .

But, the police said they had not been informed about the incident.

Meanwhile, a fight broke out at Ward 7, Unit 20, Oba, in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state as PDP agents were alleged to have been inducing voters with money while they were on the queue to vote. A PDP agent was also arrested at the polling unit.

The APC agent at the polling unit, Alhaja Monsurat Ogunfolaji, accused the PDP of attempting to disrupt the electoral process.

She said that around 3pm she noticed that a man and a woman who had not previously been identified as PDP agents showed up with the party's tag and started to share money to voters.

She raised the alarm and security agents arrested one of them.

But, speaking on behalf of the PDP, a former Chairman, Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Babatunde Adesina, alleged that the arrest was a ploy to silence PDP members at the polling unit.

Meanwhile, three policemen were involved in an accident at Wasinmi area along Lagos - Abeokuta expressway in Ewekoro local government area of the state.

The accident occurred at about 9:35 a.m while going on an election monitoring around the area.

Our correspondent who witnessed the incident observed that the rickety bus of the Nigeria Police Force belonging to Ewekoro Divisional Police somersaulted from its side facing Lagos axis and jumped to the other prompted the tyres to burst.

Oyo: Ajimobi, Akala, Ladoja upbeat

In Oyo, Governor Abiola Ajimobi, who is the governorship candidate of the APC in the elections; Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, governorship candidate of Labour Party; and Senator Rashidi Ladoja, the governorship candidate of Accord Party, commended the peaceful conduct of the polls.

Ajimobi, who voted at his polling unit, described the process as peaceful and well-organised.

Akala, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 13, Sabo-Taara, Ogbomoso, said, ""I am impressed with the peaceful way the electorate have gone all about the electoral process. I laud them for being peaceful. Although I can't describe the turn out as good, I believe the turnout will be impressive by the time voting commences. I also commend the electoral officials for being prompt in the various polling units. It shows Nigerians are developing with every election. I am also pleased with the security arrangement.""

Ladoja, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 6b, Ondo Street, Bodija, expressed reservation about the accreditation even though he said the polls were more peaceful than the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Ladoja complained that card readers were not working in some places, saying that at Olomi area of Ibadan, ballot boxes were snatched.

Sunday Vanguard observed that there was low turn-out in some places in Ibadan metropolis but some voters said it was not low turn-out, saying the efficacy of card readers this time around reduced queues at polling units.

Ondo: APC, monarch trade words on polls materials' hijack

In Ondo State, the people voted to elect only state lawmakers. But low turnout, hijacking of electoral materials and violence marked the poll.

Accreditation of voters commenced on schedule while the card readers worked better compared to when they were used during the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Reports from across the state indicated that the two major parties, PDP and APC, were out to outsmart each other.

Electoral materials going to Igbonla, Aiyetoro, Ilowo, Idi Ogba and Mahin were reportedly hijacked by thugs who ambushed INEC officials.

An NYSC official who tried to rescue the electoral materials was reportedly wounded.

In Ondo East council area, a particular candidate was said to have brought thugs to the town on Friday and guns were said to have been booming till yesterday morning.

Security operatives however put the situation under control.

In Idanre, a leader of the PDP in Igbepo camp, Isalu Ehinpetu Ward, Chief Adedeji Lucas, was said to have been attacked with machete while reportedly trying to stop thugs from snatching ballot boxes for the area.

He was rushed to Hope Specialist Hospital where he was referred to the Specialist Hospital in the town.

Sunday Vanguard gathered that the elections were also disrupted in three other wards in Idanre but the timely intervention of security operatives brought the situation under control.

Governor Olusegun Mimiko, who voted in Ward 7 Unit 20 in Ondo West council area of the state, said the election was generally peaceful except the disturbing scenario in Ondo East.

A former governorship candidate of the defunct ACN in the state, Rotimi Akeredolu, attributed the low turn out to the non-conduct of the governorship election in the state.

Akeredolu said that although the election was peaceful, the turn out was not impressive.

Meanwhile, the Olugbo of Ugboland in Ilaje area of Ondo State, Oba Fredrick Akinruntan, yesterday, denied hijacking electoral materials during the election.

Ondo State APC had alleged that the Oba, in conjunction with his son, Abayomi, who contested the House of Assembly election in the area, hijacked the materials.

The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Abayomi Adesanya, alleged, in a statement in Akure, ""Electoral materials were hijacked in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State by His Royal Majesty, Oba Frederick Obateru Akinrutan, the Okoro Ajiga 1, of Ugbo Kingdom, in conjunction with PDP. His son is a candidate of the PDP"".

But the Oba, in a telephone interview, described the allegation as spurious and embarrassing.

"" I am a traditional ruler. I do not play politics. The allegation is embarrassing"", he said.

"" I am in my palace in Ode Ugbo. I am not involved in any electoral malpractices. Its a lie.

"" I am the father of politicians. I am not involved in politics even though my son is a contestant.

""It's surprising that the APC can go to the extent of alleging that I am involved in electoral malpractices. It is unfortunate that they went this far"".

Meanwhile, the APC alleged that the ballot papers, ballot boxes and result sheets meant for election in Ayetoro community, Ugbo Ward 2, the home of the APC candidate for Ilaje Constituency 1, had been snatched by armed men

The party added: ""Also, Ilepete community, the collation centre for Ugbo Ward 3, was attacked by armed thugs; shooting of gunshots took the better part of the early hours of voting at Ilowo to scare voters away.

""The home town of Chief Omojuwa, a former director of OSOPADEC, was also under siege "".

Sokoto: Tambuwal pleads for acceptance of results

Reports from Sokoto State said Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called on contestants and Nigerians to accept the outcome of yesterday elections.

Tambuwal, who is the APC candidate in the gubernatorial election in the state, said the polls were an opportunity for the people to elect those to govern them.

Speaking after casting his vote in his polling station, Shiyar Ajiya, Tambuwal, at about 2pm, he said the elections had been peaceful.

Tambuwal said the no complaint about card readers failure showed that there was improvement in the elections compared to the presidential and National Assembly elections.

The governorship candidate said: "" We have witnessed an improvement compared to that of last two weeks.

""The process of accreditation was very smooth and I have not heard of any complaint.""

Meanwhile, voting commenced in polling stations across the state after smooth and seamless accreditation.

In most polling stations visited, voters turned up for accreditation early as many had to wait for the electoral officers to come.

In Sokoto South and North local government areas, voters turned up in large number with many expressing happiness with the card readers."

Nigerians went back to the polls on Saturday for state elections.

Violence and voter apathy characterised the gubernatorial and National Assembly elections held across the country yesterday.

It was a straight fight between the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the federal level and the opposition All Progressives Party (APC) whose candidate, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), won the March 28 presidential election.

In yesterday's elections, violence rocked at least seven states across the country leading to 16 deaths.

Five persons were feared killed in Benue; four in Kebbi; two, each, in Rivers and Lagos; and one, each, in Plateau, Bauchi and Ebonyi.

President Goodluck Jonathan blamed the low turnout in his native Bayelsa on the non-holding of the gubernatorial election in the state.

Only the House of Assembly election took place in the state.

The European Union Chief Observer to the elections, Santiago Fisas, also lament the poor voter turnout at the polls.

As the results of the elections began to trickle in, last night, reports said Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti won 25 of the 26 legislative seats in the state assembly for his party, the PDP, leaving one seat for Labour Party (LP).

Only the legislative election held in Ekiti.

Meanwhile, Governor Rotimi Amaechi faulted the conduct of the elections in Rivers State, describing it as a sham.

He also alleged that his phone number was claimed by some people to send text messages to APC supporters to ask them to ask to boycott the polls, saying it was a ploy to give advantage to the PDP in the elections.

The gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Rivers State, Mr Nyesom Wiki, immediately countered Amaechi, saying all was well with the polls in the state.

Benue: monarch, four others killed

In Benue State, the district head of Utange in Ushongo local government area, Zaki Joseph Kumbur, and four others were reported to have been killed, before and during the elections apparently marred by low turn out of voters.

This came just as INEC offices in Tarka and Ushongo local government areas were said to have been attacked by suspected hoodlums who also snatched ballot boxes in several polling units around Makurdi, the state capital, and in parts of the state in the wave of crisis and violence that affected the polls in the state.

The breakdown of the reported killings showed that two persons were shot dead in Zaki-Biam in Ukum local government area, one gunned down at the North Bank area of Makurdi and another killed in Gwer local government area.

""A young man, who was a kingpin in North Bank, also popularly known as 'Almighty', was shot in the head following disagreement with members of his gang over sharing of money"", a source said.

""In Zaki-Biam, there was sporadic shooting in the main town on the eve of the election. Two persons were discovered dead today (Saturday).

""In Gwer, a medical practitioner (names withheld) was reported to have been arrested over the alleged killing of a voter who he allegedly stabbed to death after a heated argument.""

Sunday Vanguard learnt that the Utange district head, Kumbur, was killed, Friday night in his residence by unknown armed men who stormed the place in a commando fashion.

""His death may not be unconnected with the wave of political disagreements that have characterized elections in that part of the state"", said our source.

When contacted, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ozi Obih said, the Zaki-Biam incident was a political stampede while the North Bank shooting was as a result of disagreement among friends but added that he was yet to get the confirmation of deaths.

Kebbi: Four feared killed by soldiers

In Kebbi State, soldiers allegedly killed four voters in Bayan Dutse Polling Unit, Ginga Ward in Suru Local Government Area.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident to journalists.

""Yes, we have received report of four people allegedly killed by soldiers. I will give you details of the killings as soon we conclude our investigation,"" he said.

The House of Representative member-elect, representing Suru/Bagudo federal constituency, Abdullahi Suru, also confirmed this to journalists.

He said the incident happened around noon, yesterday, as accreditation was going on in the area, which predominantly has supporters of the APC.

""A serving Area Development councillor, Ahmed Sankezu, invited the soldiers to arrest some prominent elders in the area because he was earlier prevented from accessing the PU to perfect their rigging plan"", he added.

The Army Headquarters said it didn't have information on the incident yet.

In Ebonyi State, the Chairman of the PDP in Ishielu Local Government Area, Emeka Nworie, was reportedly killed by suspected political thugs in the early hours of yesterday.

Police spokesperson, Chris Anyanwu, confirmed to Channels Television that Nworie was attacked in his house in Ezzagu where he was shot several times.

According to Anyanwu, the incident took place around 3am. He said the attackers had asked for money from their victim, which was given to them, after which they still went ahead to kill him.

The State has had its share of political violence in the run-up to the general elections. Only recently, two people were killed in Ikwo following a clash between the supporters of the PDP and Labour Party.

Lagos: 2 corpses linked to polls

In Lagos State, the governorship and legislative elections were marred by apathy in most areas despite the significant improvement in logistic management for the polls.

Two corpses found in Oshodi and along Apapa - Oshodi Road were also linked to the polls.The accreditation and voting processes were most uneventfully in many polling stations. There were no incidents or problems with the card reader and queues were absent as people went home after accreditation and came back to vote in the afternoon.

However, leaders of the two major parties in the state, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC and Chief Bode George of the PDP, in separate interviews, alleged conspiracies directed against their parties.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, REC, Mr. Akin Orebiyi, however, washed the INEC from all such allegations, saying the conduct of yesterday's polls was a significant improvement on the presidential and National Assembly elections. According to him, the commission was able to come out with the improvements after internal deliberations.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at about 1.45 p.m. at Polling Unit 047, Sunday Adigun Street, Alausa, Ikeja, Tinubu flayed what he described as the deliberate attempt to intimidate voters against the APC.

""Throughout the week before the election, there were lots of gunshots across the state. That is scary to the people and that is why they didn't even come out. That is the method of rigging,"" he said.

APC leader also alleged that the PDP-led Federal Government relegated the Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP, Mr. Kayode Aderanti, to the level of an area commander to enable it perfect it's plan to compromise the elections.

According to him, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Joseph Mbu, took over the commissioner's functions.

He, however, commended the improvement in the conduct of the elections as compared with the presidential and National Assembly polls two weeks ago.

The assertions of manipulations were, however, dismissed by Lagos PDP leader, Chief Bode George. Speaking to Sunday Vanguard shortly after voting at Evans Street, George described Tinubu's allegations as laughable.

He said: ""Who said it? Is it Bola or their noise maker? If it is their noise maker, he is from another planet. They wanted the government and they have gotten it. You cannot continuously be lying to yourself. We are trying to rig, with whom and for what? 16 years, they stayed on the saddle here in Lagos, what is the outcome? The people say they are tired of the APC and they are hounding them out of the system. The APC says we want to rig, let them say that to the marines, they are clowns"".

The accusation was also dismissed by the Chairman of the PDP in the state, Mr. Tunji Shelle.

The Minister of State for foreign affairs, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, on his part, accused the APC of waging a war of intimidation against PDP supporters.

When asked if the alleged intimidation was responsible for the voter apathy, he said ""it could be.""

His words: ""Don't forget that some sections of our soceity were threatened with death. To that extent, we have to take stock of what transpired in Lagos. From the feedback, it could be responsible.""

Governor Babatunde Fashola refused to be dragged into arguments on the cause of the apathy by voters. He, however, expressed his optimism that the APC governorship candidate, Akinwunmi Ambode, would win the polls.

""I am always optimistic of any contest. I am optimistic Ambode will emerge the winner,"" the governor said after voting in Surulere.

His deputy, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, told Sunday Vanguard at her polling unit at Egbeda Round-About in Alimosho that voters thought the presidential election was more important than the governorship.

She also pointed at improvements in the functionality of the card reader and other logistics.

The Deputy Governor, however, dismissed the allegation that many non-indigenes did not turn out because of the threat by the Oba of Lagos.

""He was not a politician or an APC member. Besides, that issue was resolved before the election. I think that basically, people wanted change at the centre and that was why they came out en-masse to vote during the last election. They must have already concluded that continuity be sustained at the state level"", she added.

The PDP governorship candidate in the state, Mr Jimi Agbaje, had, at the beginning of the day, expressed concern on the apathy by voters. Agbaje spoke to newsmen when he did his accreditation at Ward 2 Polling Unit 009, Duala/Abraham Adesanya Street, Apapa.

Police commissioner parades Lagos

The Lagos Police Commissioner, Aderanti, yesterday, paraded Lagos during the elections, spending time around Alimosho and arresting vehicles that were not on special duty that dared to come out.

Financial inducement/refreshments

Sunday Vanguard observed some refreshments in certain centres during the accreditation process and voters alleged some youths came out and shared money to voters on voting grounds. Some voters collected the money and some turned it down. In the same vein, some voters collected the refreshments and some turned them down according to our sources. One source said,"" I cannot be bought with money. This is one decision I have taken upon myself and nobody will swing my votes to favour his candidate. I didn't take their money. And I didn't take any refreshment from them. Am I a hungry man to be swayed by a bottle of La Casera and doughnut?""

Rivers: Deaths amid heavy shootings

In Rivers State, heavy shooting was reported in Ozuoba and Rumuolumeni in Obio Akpor Local Government Area.

Soldiers moved into Buguma in Asari Toru LGA where two persons were feared dead, also amid heavy shooting allegedly by political thugs. A police patrol vehicle, the house of the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Joeba West, and INEC polling centre in Kalabari National College in the town were razed by unknown arsonists.

It was learnt that about 80 per cent of the card readers deployed in Okrika were not working.

Wike and Peterside

Failure of card readers on massive scale was also reported in Abua Odua LGA where polling officers resorted to Incident Forms.

Meanwhile, Governor Chibuike Amaechi described the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections in the state as a sham, saying they were marred by ballot papers snatching and hijacking of other sensitive materials of INEC.

He also alleged that his phone number was cloned by people who used it to send text messages to APC members in the state not to participate in the elections. Amaechi spoke shortly after he was accredited at his ward in Ubima community in Ikwerre local government area. His wife was also accredited.

Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. David Iyofor, quoted his principal as saying the election was a failed exercise going by reports available to him from several parts of Rivers.

""From what we saw on our way to Ubima and reports we got from across the state, it is unfortunate this can happen"", he said. In a related development, the leader of APC in Obio Akpor LGA, Chief Tony Okocha, alleged that result sheets for nine wards in the local government were missing.

According to him, they were replaced with cloned result sheets.

Continuing, he said he had directed members of the party to only vote when they see authentic result sheets, adding that he had also complained to the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dame Gecilia Khan.

""Our people will go and vote but they should counter sign result sheets if we must vote.

Result sheets for Wards 9, 10, 11,17,13,8,2 and12 are missing"", the APC leader stated.

""I have sent text messages to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Gecilia Khan, and Professor Olurinde, sent by the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Atahiru Jega.

""These are th e results we know that have been taking. They replaced them with cloned results. We are ready for the elections. But the REC should counter sign the result sheets"".

The PDP candidate in the gubernatorial election in Rivers State, Mr. Nyesom Wike, hails from Obio Akpor LGA.

About 50 heavily armed soldiers mounted heavy blockade around the family residence of the governorship candidate.

Vehicles were thoroughly searched before being allowed to drive through Wipey Junction, a very busy intersection close to the family residence.

At about 6.40am, the soldiers were emptying sand bags from one of their trucks.

Pedestrians were seen raising their hands as they walked past the soldiers who took strategic positions with their rifles.

Wike dismissed the claim by Amaechi that the elections were a sham.

The gubernatorial candidate, who said the governor should not be taken seriously, urged politicians in Rivers to emulate Jonathan who conceded defeat in the presidential election.

""Which election has he (Amaechi) not described as a sham? He dismissed the presidential election as a sham but when Buhari won, did he not say it was an act of God?"", he said.

He accused the governor of allegedly going round some wards in Obio Akpor local government area, adding that he disrupted the election in Ward 12.

Wike also said INEC had postponed elections in Wards 15 and 16 in the local government area.

Some voters reportedly protested against the presence of Amaechi in some wards in Omagwa in Ikwerre local government area, saying he should go to Ubima where he registered.

The governorship candidate of the APC in the state, Dr Dakuku Peterside, said accreditation for the election went on smoothly in his Opobo community at the time he spoke to newsmen.

He, however, alleged that about seven members of his party were killed in Ogba Egbema Ndoni local government area. This, however, could not be confirmed from the police at press time.

He also alleged that materials were hijacked in several parts of the state.

Senator Magnus Abe, who represents Rivers South-East in the Senate, made similar allegations about Gokhana, saying the elections did not hold there.

Minister of State for Industry, Chief Kenneth Kobani, countered Abe, maintaining that the elections went on smoothly in several areas of Gokhana local government area.

Plateau: Party supporter shot dead

In Plateau State, voting was nearly marred at the Sarkin Arab Ward and environs when a young man at nearby Ali Kazaure Polling Station in Jos North Local Government Area was shot dead by a security operative.

The deceased was said to be a supporter of one of the political parties and was engaging a supporter of another party in a scuffle before the security personnel standing by intervened to end the quarrel.

In the course of the scuffle, the deceased allegedly drew out a knife but as a soldier tried to take the weapon from him. He was said to have struggled with the soldier and this infuriated the soldier who fired at him.

The timely intervention of other security agents saved the situation and normalcy was restored in the area and elections continued.

Spokesman for the Special Task Force, STF, Capt. Ikedichi Iweha, who confirmed the incident, described it as unfortunate, adding that the man engaged soldiers in a fight when they tried to intervene to prevent him from stabbing his opponent.

Meanwhile, card reader yesterday, for the second time, failed to authenticate Governor Jonah Jang, and his wife, Ngo Talatu, at their Ladura I Polling Unit in Jos South, Local Government Area of the state.

Jang and his wife had to fill incident form for accreditation just like they did during the presidential and National Assembly elections. Speaking with newsmen after filling the incident form, Jang said ""I am impressed with the turnout of citizens.

The exercise was generally peaceful and orderly in polling units monitored in local government areas in Plateau North and Plateau Central zones of the state and officials of the Independent INEC and election materials arrived the various polling units early compared to what was experienced during the March 28, polls.

Turnout was impressive as people were seen being accredited as early as 8am but the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Gyang Pwajok, who spoke with journalists, lamented that his wife and many others were deprived of voting by INEC because of the insistence on permanent voter cards, PVCs.

At the central zone, card readers were generally functioning well as hitches seen during the March, 28 polls were not witnessed in all polling units visited while voters were queuing orderly for accreditation.

Bauchi: Councillor beaten to death

In Bauchi State, the chairperson of Bogoro Local Government Area, Hassana Arkila, confirmed the death of the PDP councilor for Gizaki/Badagari Ward, Mr Musa Daniel, saying he was beaten to death by angry youths while on electoral duty.

Arkila described the attack on the councilor as unfortunate and linked the incident to saboteurs of democracy.

She said :"" I want to confirm the death of a PDP councilor who was beaten to death by irate youths. l am assuring the people of the state that the full wrath of law will catch up with the attackers"".

The chairperson appealed to the perpetrators of the dastardly act to sheath their sword and embrace peace, saying violence is not the solution to political differences.

""The death of the councillor is a signal that the APC is afraid of losing the electoral process. I ask for calm among PDP supporters"", she added.

Meanwhile, voting commenced in some polling units in the state as early as 9.00 am but there was low turn out of voters.

Some of polling units where voting commenced early are El-duniya, Daníyae and Lido Hotel polling units.

The Presiding Officer at El-duniya polling unit, Abba John, said they combined accreditation and voting because of the few numbers of voters.

He said: ""We had fewer numbers of voters unlike the presidential election when we had large turn out.

The electorate and parties agents agreed that voting should commence so that we don't stay idle"".

When asked if their action was right, John said: ""Though it's wrong, INEC told us to give the voters what they want; that is why we agreed to do it"".

The APC and PDP agents at the polling unit, Kingsley Oyenka and Musa Liman, respectively, said they agreed on the early commencement of voting.

As at 10.30 am, 67 people had voted at El-duniya while 37 had cast their votes at Lido.

Meanwhile, the card reader rejected the thumbprint of Governor Mallam Isa Yuguda at Baba Sidi Primary School, Bauchi where he had gone for accreditation for yesterday's polls.

It was a replay of the situation during the presidential and National Assembly elections two weeks ago when the card reader failed to accredit him.

Speaking with journalists after accreditation, yesterday, the governor said, ""So far, so bad, the card has rejected my thumb print again. My thumb print was rejected during presidential and National Assembly elections; the samething happened today again"".

Yuguda commended voters for their orderly conduct at polling units.

On the low turn out of voters, Yuguda said"" some of the electorates believed in the Presidential election so may be that was the reason for the low turn out but I want to urge them to come out and exercise their franchise.

The APC gubernatorial candidate in the polls, Mohammed Abubakar, while speaking with journalist, at Guru Galadima polling unit after accreditation, commended the turn out and orderliness of the voters.

Bayelsa: Jonathan explains poor voter turnout

Reports from Bayelsa State said President Goodluck Jonathan was accredited at about 10.55am at his Otuoke polling unit in an exercise characterised by low voters turnout.

The president was without his wife, Patience.

Unlike the presidential and National Assembly polls where Mr. President was subjected to about 50 minutes wait due to the malfunctioning of card readers, his accreditation, yesterday, took less than a minute.

He later visited his mother, Madam Eunice Jonathan, at her residence, a walking distance from the polling unit.

Jonathan's mother had earlier done her accreditation.

The president, in an interview with newsmen before he retired to his country home after the accreditation, expressed satisfaction with the exercise as, according to him, ""INEC has probably rectified the card reader fault.""

He blamed the poor turn of voters across Bayelsa on the fact that there was no governorship election in the state.

He however expressed hope of PDP victory in the election.

In another development, the state assembly poll in Oruma community in Ogbia council area was marred by alleged hijack of election materials by suspected thugs.

Many eligible were said to have beaten a quick retreat to their homes when the hoodlums stormed the area and carted away election materials.

Ekiti: Voters shun polls

Reports from Ekiti State where only the House of Assembly was holding claimed there was apathy on the part of voters, as the election in different parts of the state witnessed a low turn out.

A visit by our correspondent to Ado, Ikere, Ikole, Afao, Ilawe, Aramoko,Omuo, Isan, Ise and Oye, indicated apathy on the part of the electorate.

At Ise, Ilawe, Ikere, Ayedun and Ijero Ekiti some youths took the opportunity to play foodball at open fields and street roads.

However, the election was generally peaceful. Governor Ayo Fayose and his wife, Feyisetan, voted at Maternity Polling Center, Afao at about 2.02p.m

Fayose said he was satisfied with the conduct of the electorate.

Abia: Complaints galore

In Abia State, the governorship and House of Assembly elections were generally peaceful.

Reports from across the state indicated that INEC deployed materials in time and accreditation also commenced on time.

However, there were complaints from Ofeme and other communities in Ohuhu clan to the effect that the result sheets supplied to the area were fake. The same complaint was received in some communities in Umuahia South council area.

But the INEC Director of Public Education and Enlightenment, Mr. Edwin Enabor, dismissed the allegations. According to him, when the people from Ohuhu came with their complaint, the electoral officers posted to the area were called to bring the materials which he said proved that what they had were genuine INEC materials.

Also, there were areas where card readers did not work and the people reverted to the manual process. This affected areas like Obingwa, Ohafia, Umuahia South.

There was equally reports of alleged hijack of ballot papers at Ihechiowa in Arochukwu council area, World Bank Primary School and Afara Technical School in Umuahia.

Governor Theodore Orji, who voted at 2.10pm in his Ugba Primary School Unit, expressed satisfaction with the turnout of voters and their peaceful conduct and expressed the hope that it would be the same across the state.

Orji also expressed the hope that PDP would win the polls to retain power in the state.

Meanwhile, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Abia, Dr. Alex Otti, has called for the cancellation of the governorship and state assembly elections in the state, alleging that they were fraught with fraud.

Otti alleged while speaking to newsmen in his Umuehim Nvosi, Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area that the elections were marred by armed thugs suspected to be loyal to PDP who allegedly invaded polling units, shot sporadically and snatched ballot boxes.

Kwara: Optimism amid low turnout

In Kwara State, the elections were reportedly marred by low turn out.

Sunday Vanguard's visit to some polling units Ilorin,Idofian, Ipee, Ojoku among others showed low turn out, but Ajase Ipo and Offa maintained active participation of the voters with high turn out.

Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, the APC gubernatorial candidate in the elections, and the leader of the APC in the state, Senator Bukola Saraki, lamented the low turn-out of the elections.

However, the two leaders commended the peaceful conduct of the exercise, which saw voters' turn out later being impressive in the state.

Similarly, Minister of National Planning, Dr. Abubakar Sulaiman, said the voters' apathy was due to what he termed ""the lacklustre attitude of security agencies in the last elections"".

The Minister, who voted in the same polling unit with Saraki, complained of inadequate security presence in the last elections and called on INEC to relocate the three polling units at Ode Opobiyi, saying they were sited in residential areas.

Another APC chieftain, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, who voted at his Baboko Ward, said many Nigerians expect a lot from the incoming administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that they were not that concerned with the state elections.

Also, the Senior Special Adviser to Governor Ahmed on Media and Communications, Dr. Muideen Akorede, who commended the people for the ""impressive turn out,"" told journalists in Offa that his boss would be re-elected at the end of the elections.

But the Director General of the PDP Campaign in Kwara State, Deacon John Dara, said in Ipee, his hometown, that the PDP gubernatorial candidate,Senator Simeon Ajibola Ajibola, will shock book makers and win the election.

Edo: Tight security, Oshiomhole laments card reader hitches

Reports from Edo State said although only the House of Assembly poll held there, there was low voters turn out. The election was held under tight security. Voting materials arrived the entire 18 local government areas between 8:00am and 8:30am.

However, tension was more in Orhionmwon Local Government Council due to the senatorial election result expected from the area. Deputy Governor of the state, Dr Pius Odubu, described the exercise as peaceful but regretted the earlier problem encountered with card readers. Meanwhile, the results of the House of Assembly election trickling in indicated that the APC was winning many seats in the state.

In Ward 5, Ugboko Units 27 and 28, at about 11am, there was a clash between PDP and APC youths after a former Minister of State for Works, Engr. Chris Ogienwonyi, accused a PDP leader in the ward of confiscating over 40 PVCs belonging to some persons.

However, the PDP supporters insisted he should go to his unit, stressing that he was not supposed to be at the unit which they said was not his voting centre. However, APC supporters countered, asserting that a chieftain of the PDP in the state, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who came to the area during the incident was also not supposed to be there.

In Edo Central, suspected thugs invaded some polling units in Ewohinmi and carted away ballot papers. The same situation occurred in Opoji.

Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who voted in his Iyamho ward 10 at about 3:10pm, lamented the failure of the card reader in some areas and urged INEC to fish out the bad eggs frustrating the efforts of the electoral body.

The governor also said there was low voters' turnout because of the frustration they experienced with the card readers.

DELTA: Controversy as soldiers impound commissioner's car

In Delta State, controversy over the enforcement of the no vehicular movement rule on election day marred the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Asaba, the state capital, as soldiers had a running battle with motorists.

The motorists, which included top government officials, were prevented from driving to their polling units by armed soldiers who insisted on enforcing the regulation imposed by the Inspector General of Police, Suleiman Abba, to the letter.

The action of the soldiers, who raided the city, confiscating keys of drivers sent shivers down the spine of voters, as the serenity of the capital city was shattered creating tension and apprehension in the minds of voters who had finished accreditation and waiting for voting which was billed for 1pm.

In the ensuing fracas and for fear of the soldiers, many voters took to their heels as they believed that the action of soldiers could not be predicted.

Many of the cars whose keys were collected by the soldiers were left in the middle of Nnebisi Road, the most popular and busiest road in the state capital. As the raid progressed from the Flyover Bridge, the soldiers arrived at JohnBosco, the polling unit where the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Chike Ogeah, was to cast his votes.

The soldiers attempted to seize the key of the commissioner's car which led to further commotion.

Ogeah, whose attention was drawn to the incident, introduced himself to the soldiers but the soldiers refused to listen to him and insisted on impounding the car.

The commissioner accused the soldiers of scaring voters away with their action.

But a spokesman for the army, who simply identified as Olaleye O., said the seizure of keys from vehicle drivers was an order from the Inspector General of Police that no vehicular movement should be allowed on election day.

""The order of no vehicular movement means no vehicular movement between 8.am and 6pm. It's only security agents and others on essential duties that are supposed to be with their vehicles. The issue of ballot snatching is traceable to movement of vehicles and tricycles on election days"", he stated.

""So while we were going round there was a lot of vehicular movement and we decided to enforce the no vehicular movement order by the IGP. It was announced on the radio and television. People are supposed to walk to their polling units and cast their votes.

""Nobody has collected any PVC from anybody. All we are saying is that your vehicle is not supposed to be on the road"".

Answering a question on distance from residence to polling unit and the fact that there were some vehicular movements during the presidential election, Olaleye said ""we are simply enforcing an order from the Inspector General of Police"".

Ogun: Man with several PVCs held

In Ogun, the state police command arrested a man (names withheld) for unlawful possession of several Permanent Voter Cards in Abeokuta during the governorship and House of Assembly elections.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Muyiwa Adejobi, who confirmed the incident, said the command was investigating the matter.

Also, there were reports of snatching of ballot boxes in various parts of the state.

According to sources, at Westley School, Unit 002, Ward 009, two men absconded after being caught with stolen PVCs .

But, the police said they had not been informed about the incident.

Meanwhile, a fight broke out at Ward 7, Unit 20, Oba, in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state as PDP agents were alleged to have been inducing voters with money while they were on the queue to vote. A PDP agent was also arrested at the polling unit.

The APC agent at the polling unit, Alhaja Monsurat Ogunfolaji, accused the PDP of attempting to disrupt the electoral process.

She said that around 3pm she noticed that a man and a woman who had not previously been identified as PDP agents showed up with the party's tag and started to share money to voters.

She raised the alarm and security agents arrested one of them.

But, speaking on behalf of the PDP, a former Chairman, Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Babatunde Adesina, alleged that the arrest was a ploy to silence PDP members at the polling unit.

Meanwhile, three policemen were involved in an accident at Wasinmi area along Lagos - Abeokuta expressway in Ewekoro local government area of the state.

The accident occurred at about 9:35 a.m while going on an election monitoring around the area.

Our correspondent who witnessed the incident observed that the rickety bus of the Nigeria Police Force belonging to Ewekoro Divisional Police somersaulted from its side facing Lagos axis and jumped to the other prompted the tyres to burst.

Oyo: Ajimobi, Akala, Ladoja upbeat

In Oyo, Governor Abiola Ajimobi, who is the governorship candidate of the APC in the elections; Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, governorship candidate of Labour Party; and Senator Rashidi Ladoja, the governorship candidate of Accord Party, commended the peaceful conduct of the polls.

Ajimobi, who voted at his polling unit, described the process as peaceful and well-organised.

Akala, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 13, Sabo-Taara, Ogbomoso, said, ""I am impressed with the peaceful way the electorate have gone all about the electoral process. I laud them for being peaceful. Although I can't describe the turn out as good, I believe the turnout will be impressive by the time voting commences. I also commend the electoral officials for being prompt in the various polling units. It shows Nigerians are developing with every election. I am also pleased with the security arrangement.""

Ladoja, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 6b, Ondo Street, Bodija, expressed reservation about the accreditation even though he said the polls were more peaceful than the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Ladoja complained that card readers were not working in some places, saying that at Olomi area of Ibadan, ballot boxes were snatched.

Sunday Vanguard observed that there was low turn-out in some places in Ibadan metropolis but some voters said it was not low turn-out, saying the efficacy of card readers this time around reduced queues at polling units.

Ondo: APC, monarch trade words on polls materials' hijack

In Ondo State, the people voted to elect only state lawmakers. But low turnout, hijacking of electoral materials and violence marked the poll.

Accreditation of voters commenced on schedule while the card readers worked better compared to when they were used during the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Reports from across the state indicated that the two major parties, PDP and APC, were out to outsmart each other.

Electoral materials going to Igbonla, Aiyetoro, Ilowo, Idi Ogba and Mahin were reportedly hijacked by thugs who ambushed INEC officials.

An NYSC official who tried to rescue the electoral materials was reportedly wounded.

In Ondo East council area, a particular candidate was said to have brought thugs to the town on Friday and guns were said to have been booming till yesterday morning.

Security operatives however put the situation under control.

In Idanre, a leader of the PDP in Igbepo camp, Isalu Ehinpetu Ward, Chief Adedeji Lucas, was said to have been attacked with machete while reportedly trying to stop thugs from snatching ballot boxes for the area.

He was rushed to Hope Specialist Hospital where he was referred to the Specialist Hospital in the town.

Sunday Vanguard gathered that the elections were also disrupted in three other wards in Idanre but the timely intervention of security operatives brought the situation under control.

Governor Olusegun Mimiko, who voted in Ward 7 Unit 20 in Ondo West council area of the state, said the election was generally peaceful except the disturbing scenario in Ondo East.

A former governorship candidate of the defunct ACN in the state, Rotimi Akeredolu, attributed the low turn out to the non-conduct of the governorship election in the state.

Akeredolu said that although the election was peaceful, the turn out was not impressive.

Meanwhile, the Olugbo of Ugboland in Ilaje area of Ondo State, Oba Fredrick Akinruntan, yesterday, denied hijacking electoral materials during the election.

Ondo State APC had alleged that the Oba, in conjunction with his son, Abayomi, who contested the House of Assembly election in the area, hijacked the materials.

The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Abayomi Adesanya, alleged, in a statement in Akure, ""Electoral materials were hijacked in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State by His Royal Majesty, Oba Frederick Obateru Akinrutan, the Okoro Ajiga 1, of Ugbo Kingdom, in conjunction with PDP. His son is a candidate of the PDP"".

But the Oba, in a telephone interview, described the allegation as spurious and embarrassing.

"" I am a traditional ruler. I do not play politics. The allegation is embarrassing"", he said.

"" I am in my palace in Ode Ugbo. I am not involved in any electoral malpractices. Its a lie.

"" I am the father of politicians. I am not involved in politics even though my son is a contestant.

""It's surprising that the APC can go to the extent of alleging that I am involved in electoral malpractices. It is unfortunate that they went this far"".

Meanwhile, the APC alleged that the ballot papers, ballot boxes and result sheets meant for election in Ayetoro community, Ugbo Ward 2, the home of the APC candidate for Ilaje Constituency 1, had been snatched by armed men

The party added: ""Also, Ilepete community, the collation centre for Ugbo Ward 3, was attacked by armed thugs; shooting of gunshots took the better part of the early hours of voting at Ilowo to scare voters away.

""The home town of Chief Omojuwa, a former director of OSOPADEC, was also under siege "".

Sokoto: Tambuwal pleads for acceptance of results

Reports from Sokoto State said Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called on contestants and Nigerians to accept the outcome of yesterday elections.

Tambuwal, who is the APC candidate in the gubernatorial election in the state, said the polls were an opportunity for the people to elect those to govern them.

Speaking after casting his vote in his polling station, Shiyar Ajiya, Tambuwal, at about 2pm, he said the elections had been peaceful.

Tambuwal said the no complaint about card readers failure showed that there was improvement in the elections compared to the presidential and National Assembly elections.

The governorship candidate said: "" We have witnessed an improvement compared to that of last two weeks.

""The process of accreditation was very smooth and I have not heard of any complaint.""

Meanwhile, voting commenced in polling stations across the state after smooth and seamless accreditation.

In most polling stations visited, voters turned up for accreditation early as many had to wait for the electoral officers to come.

In Sokoto South and North local government areas, voters turned up in large number with many expressing happiness with the card readers."

Nigerians went back to the polls on Saturday for state elections.

Violence and voter apathy characterised the gubernatorial and National Assembly elections held across the country yesterday.

It was a straight fight between the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the federal level and the opposition All Progressives Party (APC) whose candidate, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), won the March 28 presidential election.

In yesterday's elections, violence rocked at least seven states across the country leading to 16 deaths.

Five persons were feared killed in Benue; four in Kebbi; two, each, in Rivers and Lagos; and one, each, in Plateau, Bauchi and Ebonyi.

President Goodluck Jonathan blamed the low turnout in his native Bayelsa on the non-holding of the gubernatorial election in the state.

Only the House of Assembly election took place in the state.

The European Union Chief Observer to the elections, Santiago Fisas, also lament the poor voter turnout at the polls.

As the results of the elections began to trickle in, last night, reports said Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti won 25 of the 26 legislative seats in the state assembly for his party, the PDP, leaving one seat for Labour Party (LP).

Only the legislative election held in Ekiti.

Meanwhile, Governor Rotimi Amaechi faulted the conduct of the elections in Rivers State, describing it as a sham.

He also alleged that his phone number was claimed by some people to send text messages to APC supporters to ask them to ask to boycott the polls, saying it was a ploy to give advantage to the PDP in the elections.

The gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Rivers State, Mr Nyesom Wiki, immediately countered Amaechi, saying all was well with the polls in the state.

Benue: monarch, four others killed

In Benue State, the district head of Utange in Ushongo local government area, Zaki Joseph Kumbur, and four others were reported to have been killed, before and during the elections apparently marred by low turn out of voters.

This came just as INEC offices in Tarka and Ushongo local government areas were said to have been attacked by suspected hoodlums who also snatched ballot boxes in several polling units around Makurdi, the state capital, and in parts of the state in the wave of crisis and violence that affected the polls in the state.

The breakdown of the reported killings showed that two persons were shot dead in Zaki-Biam in Ukum local government area, one gunned down at the North Bank area of Makurdi and another killed in Gwer local government area.

""A young man, who was a kingpin in North Bank, also popularly known as 'Almighty', was shot in the head following disagreement with members of his gang over sharing of money"", a source said.

""In Zaki-Biam, there was sporadic shooting in the main town on the eve of the election. Two persons were discovered dead today (Saturday).

""In Gwer, a medical practitioner (names withheld) was reported to have been arrested over the alleged killing of a voter who he allegedly stabbed to death after a heated argument.""

Sunday Vanguard learnt that the Utange district head, Kumbur, was killed, Friday night in his residence by unknown armed men who stormed the place in a commando fashion.

""His death may not be unconnected with the wave of political disagreements that have characterized elections in that part of the state"", said our source.

When contacted, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ozi Obih said, the Zaki-Biam incident was a political stampede while the North Bank shooting was as a result of disagreement among friends but added that he was yet to get the confirmation of deaths.

Kebbi: Four feared killed by soldiers

In Kebbi State, soldiers allegedly killed four voters in Bayan Dutse Polling Unit, Ginga Ward in Suru Local Government Area.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident to journalists.

""Yes, we have received report of four people allegedly killed by soldiers. I will give you details of the killings as soon we conclude our investigation,"" he said.

The House of Representative member-elect, representing Suru/Bagudo federal constituency, Abdullahi Suru, also confirmed this to journalists.

He said the incident happened around noon, yesterday, as accreditation was going on in the area, which predominantly has supporters of the APC.

""A serving Area Development councillor, Ahmed Sankezu, invited the soldiers to arrest some prominent elders in the area because he was earlier prevented from accessing the PU to perfect their rigging plan"", he added.

The Army Headquarters said it didn't have information on the incident yet.

In Ebonyi State, the Chairman of the PDP in Ishielu Local Government Area, Emeka Nworie, was reportedly killed by suspected political thugs in the early hours of yesterday.

Police spokesperson, Chris Anyanwu, confirmed to Channels Television that Nworie was attacked in his house in Ezzagu where he was shot several times.

According to Anyanwu, the incident took place around 3am. He said the attackers had asked for money from their victim, which was given to them, after which they still went ahead to kill him.

The State has had its share of political violence in the run-up to the general elections. Only recently, two people were killed in Ikwo following a clash between the supporters of the PDP and Labour Party.

Lagos: 2 corpses linked to polls

In Lagos State, the governorship and legislative elections were marred by apathy in most areas despite the significant improvement in logistic management for the polls.

Two corpses found in Oshodi and along Apapa - Oshodi Road were also linked to the polls.The accreditation and voting processes were most uneventfully in many polling stations. There were no incidents or problems with the card reader and queues were absent as people went home after accreditation and came back to vote in the afternoon.

However, leaders of the two major parties in the state, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC and Chief Bode George of the PDP, in separate interviews, alleged conspiracies directed against their parties.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner for the state, REC, Mr. Akin Orebiyi, however, washed the INEC from all such allegations, saying the conduct of yesterday's polls was a significant improvement on the presidential and National Assembly elections. According to him, the commission was able to come out with the improvements after internal deliberations.

Speaking to reporters after casting his vote at about 1.45 p.m. at Polling Unit 047, Sunday Adigun Street, Alausa, Ikeja, Tinubu flayed what he described as the deliberate attempt to intimidate voters against the APC.

""Throughout the week before the election, there were lots of gunshots across the state. That is scary to the people and that is why they didn't even come out. That is the method of rigging,"" he said.

APC leader also alleged that the PDP-led Federal Government relegated the Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP, Mr. Kayode Aderanti, to the level of an area commander to enable it perfect it's plan to compromise the elections.

According to him, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Joseph Mbu, took over the commissioner's functions.

He, however, commended the improvement in the conduct of the elections as compared with the presidential and National Assembly polls two weeks ago.

The assertions of manipulations were, however, dismissed by Lagos PDP leader, Chief Bode George. Speaking to Sunday Vanguard shortly after voting at Evans Street, George described Tinubu's allegations as laughable.

He said: ""Who said it? Is it Bola or their noise maker? If it is their noise maker, he is from another planet. They wanted the government and they have gotten it. You cannot continuously be lying to yourself. We are trying to rig, with whom and for what? 16 years, they stayed on the saddle here in Lagos, what is the outcome? The people say they are tired of the APC and they are hounding them out of the system. The APC says we want to rig, let them say that to the marines, they are clowns"".

The accusation was also dismissed by the Chairman of the PDP in the state, Mr. Tunji Shelle.

The Minister of State for foreign affairs, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, on his part, accused the APC of waging a war of intimidation against PDP supporters.

When asked if the alleged intimidation was responsible for the voter apathy, he said ""it could be.""

His words: ""Don't forget that some sections of our soceity were threatened with death. To that extent, we have to take stock of what transpired in Lagos. From the feedback, it could be responsible.""

Governor Babatunde Fashola refused to be dragged into arguments on the cause of the apathy by voters. He, however, expressed his optimism that the APC governorship candidate, Akinwunmi Ambode, would win the polls.

""I am always optimistic of any contest. I am optimistic Ambode will emerge the winner,"" the governor said after voting in Surulere.

His deputy, Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, told Sunday Vanguard at her polling unit at Egbeda Round-About in Alimosho that voters thought the presidential election was more important than the governorship.

She also pointed at improvements in the functionality of the card reader and other logistics.

The Deputy Governor, however, dismissed the allegation that many non-indigenes did not turn out because of the threat by the Oba of Lagos.

""He was not a politician or an APC member. Besides, that issue was resolved before the election. I think that basically, people wanted change at the centre and that was why they came out en-masse to vote during the last election. They must have already concluded that continuity be sustained at the state level"", she added.

The PDP governorship candidate in the state, Mr Jimi Agbaje, had, at the beginning of the day, expressed concern on the apathy by voters. Agbaje spoke to newsmen when he did his accreditation at Ward 2 Polling Unit 009, Duala/Abraham Adesanya Street, Apapa.

Police commissioner parades Lagos

The Lagos Police Commissioner, Aderanti, yesterday, paraded Lagos during the elections, spending time around Alimosho and arresting vehicles that were not on special duty that dared to come out.

Financial inducement/refreshments

Sunday Vanguard observed some refreshments in certain centres during the accreditation process and voters alleged some youths came out and shared money to voters on voting grounds. Some voters collected the money and some turned it down. In the same vein, some voters collected the refreshments and some turned them down according to our sources. One source said,"" I cannot be bought with money. This is one decision I have taken upon myself and nobody will swing my votes to favour his candidate. I didn't take their money. And I didn't take any refreshment from them. Am I a hungry man to be swayed by a bottle of La Casera and doughnut?""

Rivers: Deaths amid heavy shootings

In Rivers State, heavy shooting was reported in Ozuoba and Rumuolumeni in Obio Akpor Local Government Area.

Soldiers moved into Buguma in Asari Toru LGA where two persons were feared dead, also amid heavy shooting allegedly by political thugs. A police patrol vehicle, the house of the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Joeba West, and INEC polling centre in Kalabari National College in the town were razed by unknown arsonists.

It was learnt that about 80 per cent of the card readers deployed in Okrika were not working.

Wike and Peterside

Failure of card readers on massive scale was also reported in Abua Odua LGA where polling officers resorted to Incident Forms.

Meanwhile, Governor Chibuike Amaechi described the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections in the state as a sham, saying they were marred by ballot papers snatching and hijacking of other sensitive materials of INEC.

He also alleged that his phone number was cloned by people who used it to send text messages to APC members in the state not to participate in the elections. Amaechi spoke shortly after he was accredited at his ward in Ubima community in Ikwerre local government area. His wife was also accredited.

Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. David Iyofor, quoted his principal as saying the election was a failed exercise going by reports available to him from several parts of Rivers.

""From what we saw on our way to Ubima and reports we got from across the state, it is unfortunate this can happen"", he said. In a related development, the leader of APC in Obio Akpor LGA, Chief Tony Okocha, alleged that result sheets for nine wards in the local government were missing.

According to him, they were replaced with cloned result sheets.

Continuing, he said he had directed members of the party to only vote when they see authentic result sheets, adding that he had also complained to the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Dame Gecilia Khan.

""Our people will go and vote but they should counter sign result sheets if we must vote.

Result sheets for Wards 9, 10, 11,17,13,8,2 and12 are missing"", the APC leader stated.

""I have sent text messages to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Gecilia Khan, and Professor Olurinde, sent by the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Atahiru Jega.

""These are th e results we know that have been taking. They replaced them with cloned results. We are ready for the elections. But the REC should counter sign the result sheets"".

The PDP candidate in the gubernatorial election in Rivers State, Mr. Nyesom Wike, hails from Obio Akpor LGA.

About 50 heavily armed soldiers mounted heavy blockade around the family residence of the governorship candidate.

Vehicles were thoroughly searched before being allowed to drive through Wipey Junction, a very busy intersection close to the family residence.

At about 6.40am, the soldiers were emptying sand bags from one of their trucks.

Pedestrians were seen raising their hands as they walked past the soldiers who took strategic positions with their rifles.

Wike dismissed the claim by Amaechi that the elections were a sham.

The gubernatorial candidate, who said the governor should not be taken seriously, urged politicians in Rivers to emulate Jonathan who conceded defeat in the presidential election.

""Which election has he (Amaechi) not described as a sham? He dismissed the presidential election as a sham but when Buhari won, did he not say it was an act of God?"", he said.

He accused the governor of allegedly going round some wards in Obio Akpor local government area, adding that he disrupted the election in Ward 12.

Wike also said INEC had postponed elections in Wards 15 and 16 in the local government area.

Some voters reportedly protested against the presence of Amaechi in some wards in Omagwa in Ikwerre local government area, saying he should go to Ubima where he registered.

The governorship candidate of the APC in the state, Dr Dakuku Peterside, said accreditation for the election went on smoothly in his Opobo community at the time he spoke to newsmen.

He, however, alleged that about seven members of his party were killed in Ogba Egbema Ndoni local government area. This, however, could not be confirmed from the police at press time.

He also alleged that materials were hijacked in several parts of the state.

Senator Magnus Abe, who represents Rivers South-East in the Senate, made similar allegations about Gokhana, saying the elections did not hold there.

Minister of State for Industry, Chief Kenneth Kobani, countered Abe, maintaining that the elections went on smoothly in several areas of Gokhana local government area.

Plateau: Party supporter shot dead

In Plateau State, voting was nearly marred at the Sarkin Arab Ward and environs when a young man at nearby Ali Kazaure Polling Station in Jos North Local Government Area was shot dead by a security operative.

The deceased was said to be a supporter of one of the political parties and was engaging a supporter of another party in a scuffle before the security personnel standing by intervened to end the quarrel.

In the course of the scuffle, the deceased allegedly drew out a knife but as a soldier tried to take the weapon from him. He was said to have struggled with the soldier and this infuriated the soldier who fired at him.

The timely intervention of other security agents saved the situation and normalcy was restored in the area and elections continued.

Spokesman for the Special Task Force, STF, Capt. Ikedichi Iweha, who confirmed the incident, described it as unfortunate, adding that the man engaged soldiers in a fight when they tried to intervene to prevent him from stabbing his opponent.

Meanwhile, card reader yesterday, for the second time, failed to authenticate Governor Jonah Jang, and his wife, Ngo Talatu, at their Ladura I Polling Unit in Jos South, Local Government Area of the state.

Jang and his wife had to fill incident form for accreditation just like they did during the presidential and National Assembly elections. Speaking with newsmen after filling the incident form, Jang said ""I am impressed with the turnout of citizens.

The exercise was generally peaceful and orderly in polling units monitored in local government areas in Plateau North and Plateau Central zones of the state and officials of the Independent INEC and election materials arrived the various polling units early compared to what was experienced during the March 28, polls.

Turnout was impressive as people were seen being accredited as early as 8am but the PDP gubernatorial candidate, Gyang Pwajok, who spoke with journalists, lamented that his wife and many others were deprived of voting by INEC because of the insistence on permanent voter cards, PVCs.

At the central zone, card readers were generally functioning well as hitches seen during the March, 28 polls were not witnessed in all polling units visited while voters were queuing orderly for accreditation.

Bauchi: Councillor beaten to death

In Bauchi State, the chairperson of Bogoro Local Government Area, Hassana Arkila, confirmed the death of the PDP councilor for Gizaki/Badagari Ward, Mr Musa Daniel, saying he was beaten to death by angry youths while on electoral duty.

Arkila described the attack on the councilor as unfortunate and linked the incident to saboteurs of democracy.

She said :"" I want to confirm the death of a PDP councilor who was beaten to death by irate youths. l am assuring the people of the state that the full wrath of law will catch up with the attackers"".

The chairperson appealed to the perpetrators of the dastardly act to sheath their sword and embrace peace, saying violence is not the solution to political differences.

""The death of the councillor is a signal that the APC is afraid of losing the electoral process. I ask for calm among PDP supporters"", she added.

Meanwhile, voting commenced in some polling units in the state as early as 9.00 am but there was low turn out of voters.

Some of polling units where voting commenced early are El-duniya, Daníyae and Lido Hotel polling units.

The Presiding Officer at El-duniya polling unit, Abba John, said they combined accreditation and voting because of the few numbers of voters.

He said: ""We had fewer numbers of voters unlike the presidential election when we had large turn out.

The electorate and parties agents agreed that voting should commence so that we don't stay idle"".

When asked if their action was right, John said: ""Though it's wrong, INEC told us to give the voters what they want; that is why we agreed to do it"".

The APC and PDP agents at the polling unit, Kingsley Oyenka and Musa Liman, respectively, said they agreed on the early commencement of voting.

As at 10.30 am, 67 people had voted at El-duniya while 37 had cast their votes at Lido.

Meanwhile, the card reader rejected the thumbprint of Governor Mallam Isa Yuguda at Baba Sidi Primary School, Bauchi where he had gone for accreditation for yesterday's polls.

It was a replay of the situation during the presidential and National Assembly elections two weeks ago when the card reader failed to accredit him.

Speaking with journalists after accreditation, yesterday, the governor said, ""So far, so bad, the card has rejected my thumb print again. My thumb print was rejected during presidential and National Assembly elections; the samething happened today again"".

Yuguda commended voters for their orderly conduct at polling units.

On the low turn out of voters, Yuguda said"" some of the electorates believed in the Presidential election so may be that was the reason for the low turn out but I want to urge them to come out and exercise their franchise.

The APC gubernatorial candidate in the polls, Mohammed Abubakar, while speaking with journalist, at Guru Galadima polling unit after accreditation, commended the turn out and orderliness of the voters.

Bayelsa: Jonathan explains poor voter turnout

Reports from Bayelsa State said President Goodluck Jonathan was accredited at about 10.55am at his Otuoke polling unit in an exercise characterised by low voters turnout.

The president was without his wife, Patience.

Unlike the presidential and National Assembly polls where Mr. President was subjected to about 50 minutes wait due to the malfunctioning of card readers, his accreditation, yesterday, took less than a minute.

He later visited his mother, Madam Eunice Jonathan, at her residence, a walking distance from the polling unit.

Jonathan's mother had earlier done her accreditation.

The president, in an interview with newsmen before he retired to his country home after the accreditation, expressed satisfaction with the exercise as, according to him, ""INEC has probably rectified the card reader fault.""

He blamed the poor turn of voters across Bayelsa on the fact that there was no governorship election in the state.

He however expressed hope of PDP victory in the election.

In another development, the state assembly poll in Oruma community in Ogbia council area was marred by alleged hijack of election materials by suspected thugs.

Many eligible were said to have beaten a quick retreat to their homes when the hoodlums stormed the area and carted away election materials.

Ekiti: Voters shun polls

Reports from Ekiti State where only the House of Assembly was holding claimed there was apathy on the part of voters, as the election in different parts of the state witnessed a low turn out.

A visit by our correspondent to Ado, Ikere, Ikole, Afao, Ilawe, Aramoko,Omuo, Isan, Ise and Oye, indicated apathy on the part of the electorate.

At Ise, Ilawe, Ikere, Ayedun and Ijero Ekiti some youths took the opportunity to play foodball at open fields and street roads.

However, the election was generally peaceful. Governor Ayo Fayose and his wife, Feyisetan, voted at Maternity Polling Center, Afao at about 2.02p.m

Fayose said he was satisfied with the conduct of the electorate.

Abia: Complaints galore

In Abia State, the governorship and House of Assembly elections were generally peaceful.

Reports from across the state indicated that INEC deployed materials in time and accreditation also commenced on time.

However, there were complaints from Ofeme and other communities in Ohuhu clan to the effect that the result sheets supplied to the area were fake. The same complaint was received in some communities in Umuahia South council area.

But the INEC Director of Public Education and Enlightenment, Mr. Edwin Enabor, dismissed the allegations. According to him, when the people from Ohuhu came with their complaint, the electoral officers posted to the area were called to bring the materials which he said proved that what they had were genuine INEC materials.

Also, there were areas where card readers did not work and the people reverted to the manual process. This affected areas like Obingwa, Ohafia, Umuahia South.

There was equally reports of alleged hijack of ballot papers at Ihechiowa in Arochukwu council area, World Bank Primary School and Afara Technical School in Umuahia.

Governor Theodore Orji, who voted at 2.10pm in his Ugba Primary School Unit, expressed satisfaction with the turnout of voters and their peaceful conduct and expressed the hope that it would be the same across the state.

Orji also expressed the hope that PDP would win the polls to retain power in the state.

Meanwhile, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Abia, Dr. Alex Otti, has called for the cancellation of the governorship and state assembly elections in the state, alleging that they were fraught with fraud.

Otti alleged while speaking to newsmen in his Umuehim Nvosi, Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area that the elections were marred by armed thugs suspected to be loyal to PDP who allegedly invaded polling units, shot sporadically and snatched ballot boxes.

Kwara: Optimism amid low turnout

In Kwara State, the elections were reportedly marred by low turn out.

Sunday Vanguard's visit to some polling units Ilorin,Idofian, Ipee, Ojoku among others showed low turn out, but Ajase Ipo and Offa maintained active participation of the voters with high turn out.

Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, the APC gubernatorial candidate in the elections, and the leader of the APC in the state, Senator Bukola Saraki, lamented the low turn-out of the elections.

However, the two leaders commended the peaceful conduct of the exercise, which saw voters' turn out later being impressive in the state.

Similarly, Minister of National Planning, Dr. Abubakar Sulaiman, said the voters' apathy was due to what he termed ""the lacklustre attitude of security agencies in the last elections"".

The Minister, who voted in the same polling unit with Saraki, complained of inadequate security presence in the last elections and called on INEC to relocate the three polling units at Ode Opobiyi, saying they were sited in residential areas.

Another APC chieftain, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, who voted at his Baboko Ward, said many Nigerians expect a lot from the incoming administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that they were not that concerned with the state elections.

Also, the Senior Special Adviser to Governor Ahmed on Media and Communications, Dr. Muideen Akorede, who commended the people for the ""impressive turn out,"" told journalists in Offa that his boss would be re-elected at the end of the elections.

But the Director General of the PDP Campaign in Kwara State, Deacon John Dara, said in Ipee, his hometown, that the PDP gubernatorial candidate,Senator Simeon Ajibola Ajibola, will shock book makers and win the election.

Edo: Tight security, Oshiomhole laments card reader hitches

Reports from Edo State said although only the House of Assembly poll held there, there was low voters turn out. The election was held under tight security. Voting materials arrived the entire 18 local government areas between 8:00am and 8:30am.

However, tension was more in Orhionmwon Local Government Council due to the senatorial election result expected from the area. Deputy Governor of the state, Dr Pius Odubu, described the exercise as peaceful but regretted the earlier problem encountered with card readers. Meanwhile, the results of the House of Assembly election trickling in indicated that the APC was winning many seats in the state.

In Ward 5, Ugboko Units 27 and 28, at about 11am, there was a clash between PDP and APC youths after a former Minister of State for Works, Engr. Chris Ogienwonyi, accused a PDP leader in the ward of confiscating over 40 PVCs belonging to some persons.

However, the PDP supporters insisted he should go to his unit, stressing that he was not supposed to be at the unit which they said was not his voting centre. However, APC supporters countered, asserting that a chieftain of the PDP in the state, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who came to the area during the incident was also not supposed to be there.

In Edo Central, suspected thugs invaded some polling units in Ewohinmi and carted away ballot papers. The same situation occurred in Opoji.

Governor Adams Oshiomhole, who voted in his Iyamho ward 10 at about 3:10pm, lamented the failure of the card reader in some areas and urged INEC to fish out the bad eggs frustrating the efforts of the electoral body.

The governor also said there was low voters' turnout because of the frustration they experienced with the card readers.

DELTA: Controversy as soldiers impound commissioner's car

In Delta State, controversy over the enforcement of the no vehicular movement rule on election day marred the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Asaba, the state capital, as soldiers had a running battle with motorists.

The motorists, which included top government officials, were prevented from driving to their polling units by armed soldiers who insisted on enforcing the regulation imposed by the Inspector General of Police, Suleiman Abba, to the letter.

The action of the soldiers, who raided the city, confiscating keys of drivers sent shivers down the spine of voters, as the serenity of the capital city was shattered creating tension and apprehension in the minds of voters who had finished accreditation and waiting for voting which was billed for 1pm.

In the ensuing fracas and for fear of the soldiers, many voters took to their heels as they believed that the action of soldiers could not be predicted.

Many of the cars whose keys were collected by the soldiers were left in the middle of Nnebisi Road, the most popular and busiest road in the state capital. As the raid progressed from the Flyover Bridge, the soldiers arrived at JohnBosco, the polling unit where the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Chike Ogeah, was to cast his votes.

The soldiers attempted to seize the key of the commissioner's car which led to further commotion.

Ogeah, whose attention was drawn to the incident, introduced himself to the soldiers but the soldiers refused to listen to him and insisted on impounding the car.

The commissioner accused the soldiers of scaring voters away with their action.

But a spokesman for the army, who simply identified as Olaleye O., said the seizure of keys from vehicle drivers was an order from the Inspector General of Police that no vehicular movement should be allowed on election day.

""The order of no vehicular movement means no vehicular movement between 8.am and 6pm. It's only security agents and others on essential duties that are supposed to be with their vehicles. The issue of ballot snatching is traceable to movement of vehicles and tricycles on election days"", he stated.

""So while we were going round there was a lot of vehicular movement and we decided to enforce the no vehicular movement order by the IGP. It was announced on the radio and television. People are supposed to walk to their polling units and cast their votes.

""Nobody has collected any PVC from anybody. All we are saying is that your vehicle is not supposed to be on the road"".

Answering a question on distance from residence to polling unit and the fact that there were some vehicular movements during the presidential election, Olaleye said ""we are simply enforcing an order from the Inspector General of Police"".

Ogun: Man with several PVCs held

In Ogun, the state police command arrested a man (names withheld) for unlawful possession of several Permanent Voter Cards in Abeokuta during the governorship and House of Assembly elections.

The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Muyiwa Adejobi, who confirmed the incident, said the command was investigating the matter.

Also, there were reports of snatching of ballot boxes in various parts of the state.

According to sources, at Westley School, Unit 002, Ward 009, two men absconded after being caught with stolen PVCs .

But, the police said they had not been informed about the incident.

Meanwhile, a fight broke out at Ward 7, Unit 20, Oba, in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state as PDP agents were alleged to have been inducing voters with money while they were on the queue to vote. A PDP agent was also arrested at the polling unit.

The APC agent at the polling unit, Alhaja Monsurat Ogunfolaji, accused the PDP of attempting to disrupt the electoral process.

She said that around 3pm she noticed that a man and a woman who had not previously been identified as PDP agents showed up with the party's tag and started to share money to voters.

She raised the alarm and security agents arrested one of them.

But, speaking on behalf of the PDP, a former Chairman, Obafemi Owode Local Government Area, Babatunde Adesina, alleged that the arrest was a ploy to silence PDP members at the polling unit.

Meanwhile, three policemen were involved in an accident at Wasinmi area along Lagos - Abeokuta expressway in Ewekoro local government area of the state.

The accident occurred at about 9:35 a.m while going on an election monitoring around the area.

Our correspondent who witnessed the incident observed that the rickety bus of the Nigeria Police Force belonging to Ewekoro Divisional Police somersaulted from its side facing Lagos axis and jumped to the other prompted the tyres to burst.

Oyo: Ajimobi, Akala, Ladoja upbeat

In Oyo, Governor Abiola Ajimobi, who is the governorship candidate of the APC in the elections; Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, governorship candidate of Labour Party; and Senator Rashidi Ladoja, the governorship candidate of Accord Party, commended the peaceful conduct of the polls.

Ajimobi, who voted at his polling unit, described the process as peaceful and well-organised.

Akala, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 13, Sabo-Taara, Ogbomoso, said, ""I am impressed with the peaceful way the electorate have gone all about the electoral process. I laud them for being peaceful. Although I can't describe the turn out as good, I believe the turnout will be impressive by the time voting commences. I also commend the electoral officials for being prompt in the various polling units. It shows Nigerians are developing with every election. I am also pleased with the security arrangement.""

Ladoja, accredited at Ward 10, Unit 6b, Ondo Street, Bodija, expressed reservation about the accreditation even though he said the polls were more peaceful than the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Ladoja complained that card readers were not working in some places, saying that at Olomi area of Ibadan, ballot boxes were snatched.

Sunday Vanguard observed that there was low turn-out in some places in Ibadan metropolis but some voters said it was not low turn-out, saying the efficacy of card readers this time around reduced queues at polling units.

Ondo: APC, monarch trade words on polls materials' hijack

In Ondo State, the people voted to elect only state lawmakers. But low turnout, hijacking of electoral materials and violence marked the poll.

Accreditation of voters commenced on schedule while the card readers worked better compared to when they were used during the presidential and National Assembly elections.

Reports from across the state indicated that the two major parties, PDP and APC, were out to outsmart each other.

Electoral materials going to Igbonla, Aiyetoro, Ilowo, Idi Ogba and Mahin were reportedly hijacked by thugs who ambushed INEC officials.

An NYSC official who tried to rescue the electoral materials was reportedly wounded.

In Ondo East council area, a particular candidate was said to have brought thugs to the town on Friday and guns were said to have been booming till yesterday morning.

Security operatives however put the situation under control.

In Idanre, a leader of the PDP in Igbepo camp, Isalu Ehinpetu Ward, Chief Adedeji Lucas, was said to have been attacked with machete while reportedly trying to stop thugs from snatching ballot boxes for the area.

He was rushed to Hope Specialist Hospital where he was referred to the Specialist Hospital in the town.

Sunday Vanguard gathered that the elections were also disrupted in three other wards in Idanre but the timely intervention of security operatives brought the situation under control.

Governor Olusegun Mimiko, who voted in Ward 7 Unit 20 in Ondo West council area of the state, said the election was generally peaceful except the disturbing scenario in Ondo East.

A former governorship candidate of the defunct ACN in the state, Rotimi Akeredolu, attributed the low turn out to the non-conduct of the governorship election in the state.

Akeredolu said that although the election was peaceful, the turn out was not impressive.

Meanwhile, the Olugbo of Ugboland in Ilaje area of Ondo State, Oba Fredrick Akinruntan, yesterday, denied hijacking electoral materials during the election.

Ondo State APC had alleged that the Oba, in conjunction with his son, Abayomi, who contested the House of Assembly election in the area, hijacked the materials.

The state Publicity Secretary of the party, Abayomi Adesanya, alleged, in a statement in Akure, ""Electoral materials were hijacked in Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State by His Royal Majesty, Oba Frederick Obateru Akinrutan, the Okoro Ajiga 1, of Ugbo Kingdom, in conjunction with PDP. His son is a candidate of the PDP"".

But the Oba, in a telephone interview, described the allegation as spurious and embarrassing.

"" I am a traditional ruler. I do not play politics. The allegation is embarrassing"", he said.

"" I am in my palace in Ode Ugbo. I am not involved in any electoral malpractices. Its a lie.

"" I am the father of politicians. I am not involved in politics even though my son is a contestant.

""It's surprising that the APC can go to the extent of alleging that I am involved in electoral malpractices. It is unfortunate that they went this far"".

Meanwhile, the APC alleged that the ballot papers, ballot boxes and result sheets meant for election in Ayetoro community, Ugbo Ward 2, the home of the APC candidate for Ilaje Constituency 1, had been snatched by armed men

The party added: ""Also, Ilepete community, the collation centre for Ugbo Ward 3, was attacked by armed thugs; shooting of gunshots took the better part of the early hours of voting at Ilowo to scare voters away.

""The home town of Chief Omojuwa, a former director of OSOPADEC, was also under siege "".

Sokoto: Tambuwal pleads for acceptance of results

Reports from Sokoto State said Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, called on contestants and Nigerians to accept the outcome of yesterday elections.

Tambuwal, who is the APC candidate in the gubernatorial election in the state, said the polls were an opportunity for the people to elect those to govern them.

Speaking after casting his vote in his polling station, Shiyar Ajiya, Tambuwal, at about 2pm, he said the elections had been peaceful.

Tambuwal said the no complaint about card readers failure showed that there was improvement in the elections compared to the presidential and National Assembly elections.

The governorship candidate said: "" We have witnessed an improvement compared to that of last two weeks.

""The process of accreditation was very smooth and I have not heard of any complaint.""

Meanwhile, voting commenced in polling stations across the state after smooth and seamless accreditation.

In most polling stations visited, voters turned up for accreditation early as many had to wait for the electoral officers to come.

In Sokoto South and North local government areas, voters turned up in large number with many expressing happiness with the card readers."

The Syrian national identified as Mah Fath Nagor, an engineer with RIM Construction Company, was abducted on Monday evening after the kidnappers came to the site where he and other construction workers were working and started shooting sporadically into the air to scare away onlookers.

Afterwards, they forced the Syrian into their waiting vehicle and sped off to an unknown destination.

The kidnapers of Fath Nagor are now demanding a sum of fifty million naira as ransom for his release.

THE level of violence in Rivers State took a fresh turn on Saturday and Sunday as four persons were killed in Eleme and Okrika Local Government Areas of the state.

Two persons were attacked by gunmen in Okrika, including a man that was killed in his car and taken away by his assailants.

The incident, which was said to have happened at about 8pm, shocked indigenes of the area, even as another victim fell to the bullets of gunmen in his house in the same Okrika.

A source, who expressed shock over the attacks on Saturday, explained that the second victim was killed inside his residence, his body was found floating on a river.

In Ebubu community, Eleme Local Government Area, two persons were killed on Sunday during a clash between two rival cult groups.

Though no reason has been ascertained to be the cause of the clash, the rival cult groups had fought each other with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons.

Some members of the community had deserted the place in order to avoid being caught in the middle of the clash that took place around 8pm and continued till the early hours of Monday.

In another development, the All Progressives Congress in the state, has alleged that the killings of its members have continued without abating.

The state chapter of the APC condemned the latest killings involving two persons in Okrika Local Government Area.

Calling for an immediate end to the killings, the Greater Together Campaign Organisation of the governorship candidate of the APC in the last election, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, warned that the ugly act could have adverse effect if nothing was done to stop it.

A statement signed by the Director of Communications of the campaign outfit, Mrs. Ibim Semenitari, sought explanation why those behind the killings were interested in turning the state to a battlefield.

“We are calling for proactive steps by security agencies to curtail the ability of the perpetrators and their possible sponsors to hit their targets. We want to know the rationale behind the post-election killings. If they killed APC members on election days, why have they continued to kill after the polls?

“Since the discredited Governorship and House of Assembly elections in Rivers State, killers have swarmed on Ahoada East, hitting down their targets. Recently, Messrs Chigba Apollos and Chiezule German, both members of the APC in the area, were shot dead in Ibarikpo Town by gunmen. Ibarikpo is in Ahoada East Ward 13.

“In a similar bizarre manner, on Thursday, April 15, Mr. Saturday Wakama, was killed and his corpse taken away. Wakama, a popular APC member in Okrika, was a member of the Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, and had championed campaigns for a riverine governor in Rivers State,” the statement reads.

The campaign outfit, however, expressed surprise that security agencies had not been able to arrest any of the killers or kidnappers so that they could be punished for their atrocities.

“This is an indictment on the agencies of state saddled with the responsibility of tackling law breakers. An arrest and prosecution will send strong warning to these outlaws and possibly stem the tide of growing murder of APC members in Rivers State,” Peterside’s campaign group added."

Paul added that the matter was immediately reported at the Ushongu Police Station and the officer was arrested.

He added that that the corpse had been deposited at St. Monica’s Hospital in Adipko, Kwande LGA.

Suspected Fulani mercenaries, in the early hours of Monday, attacked some villages in the Donga Local Government Area of Taraba State and killed 15 persons. Many, reports said, were still missing.

Following the Monday attack there was massive movement of people from Donga Local Government, which is one of the areas in the state where run-off election was billed to hold next Saturday.

One eyewitness told our correspondent that the gunmen killed one Msugh Gaza and three of his sons in Gaza Village, while the three other victims were killed in Tse-Gbaun and Ayiase villages.

The eyewitness said, “The attack happened in the early hours of today (Monday), and the area is not safe as I talk to you, and as such we cannot search for the other missing persons. But we have, so far, recovered seven dead bodies.”

The Police spokesman in the state, Joseph Kwaji, said efforts to reach the DPO of Donga for details of the attacks were unsuccessful as his mobile phone was switched off.

However, an aide of the acting Governor of the state, Alhaji Sani Danladi, said his boss had directed that military personnel be deployed in the area to maintain peace and order.

“The terrorists, numbering over 2,000, appeared from various directions on Thursday and engaged the soldiers in Kirenowa town and adjoining communities in Marte,” said Imamu Habeeb, a local community leader.

“They fought with soldiers over the night and the fight continued today (Friday), forcing hundreds of soldiers to flee,” he added from Borno State capital, Maiduguri.

Local fighter Shehu Dan Baiwa said the more than 2,000 fighters had been armed with bombs and tanks.

“They used the weapons without restraint and succeeded in killing several people,” he said.

This is the third time Boko Haram has seized control of Marte in restive Borno State, a key battleground of their six-year insurgency, which has killed more than 13,000 and left 1.5 million persons homeless.

The city is among several retaken in recent weeks by Nigeria’s military, which has launched an offensive against the Islamists as part of a regional operation supported by Chad, Cameroon and Niger.

But Boko Haram have been fighting back, and unconfirmed reports said the soldiers were forced to retreat from Boko Haram’s Sambisa Forest stronghold this week after a landmine blast killed one soldier and three vigilantes.

A senior local politician confirmed, on condition of anonymity, that the insurgents had retaken Marte.

“We lost many (people) because some of our people that fled to Chad and Cameroon have returned after troops recovered the town recently,” he added.

A senior military official confirmed the attack on Marte, but refused to say whether Boko Haram had retaken the town, describing the army’s retreat as “strategic”."

One person was feared dead on Saturday as youths of the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress clashed at Anyigba Okura constituency of Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State.

The clash occurred during the supplementary election in some wards and polling units across six LGAs of Kogi State.

One person, Ibrahim Oyibo, 26, was said to have died while several others sustained varying degrees of gunshot wounds during the confrontation.

The candidate of the PDP in Anyigba Okura constituency, Alhassan Ogwu, said Oyibo was his cousin.

According to him the young man was with him in the house when gunmen on motorcycles, numbering about 10, stormed his residence.

He alleged that they shot sporadically at his residence for a long time and later shot Oyibo dead on the spot.

He added that riot policemen on patrol later dislodged the assailants.

Mr. John Makolo, the media officer to the APC candidate, Abdullahi Bewa, said he was unaware of the attack.

He challenged Ogwu to identify the attackers, saying if the attack occurred, Ogwu should be able to name Oyibo’s killers.

“My principal is very busy with the election and will not be ready to trade words with Ogwu. He should stop crying foul when there is none,” he said.

Cars and buildings vandalised by youths in Ilorin, Kwara State … on Saturday

Two unnamed persons died in Ilorin, Kwara State, on Saturday as hoodlums went on rampage destroying houses and cars.

The thugs also reportedly attacked the residence of the Kwara State Commandant of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Mr. Reuben Appiah.

Eight of the hoodlums armed with dangerous objects were said to have also disrupted a court session at Oja-Oba area of the state.

Some of the protesting youths were said to be protesting against the closure of roads during the monthly sanitation exercise.

They razed shops, houses and property worth millions of naira. Two accounts were given for the cause of the pandemonium.

The Kwara State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ajayi Okesanmi, said trouble started when some youths at Ojo-Oba saw an official of the NDLEA who was among the team that arrested some miscreants suspected to be involved in illicit drug.

He stated that the miscreants attacked the unnamed NDLEA official who later escaped and ran to a nearby police station for safety.

Okesanmi said, “The mayhem was as a result of a problem between the NDLEA and some suspected drug users in that area. That was what caused the crisis but the police came and rescued the NDLEA officer and we tried to control the miscreants there.

“Some houses have been attacked. We have arrested some people. I can confirm that two people died. They attacked anything in sight. They did not identify any special place to attack. They were just attacking. The crisis was caused by the claim that officials of the NDLEA arrested one of them in the past.

“The hoodlums on Saturday sighted one of the NDLEA officers that was involved in the arrest in that area. He ran to police station and police tried to rescue him. The hoodlums became annoyed and started attacking houses and people.”

Another version of what cause the destruction had it that some hoodlums protested the enforcement of the restriction of movement by law enforcement agents during the monthly environment sanitation.

Our correspondent gathered that the mobile courts’ presiding judges and sanitation officers fled when the angry youths besieged the court.

An eyewitness who pleaded anonymity for fear of attack said trouble started when a police man allegedly arrested a commercial motorcycle rider at Ojo-Oba for flouting the movement restriction order.

The source said the rider is a member of the gang led by one Ariyo.

The eyewitness said the police officer refused to accede to the pleadings of the motorcyclist to allow him go even as he claimed that the motorcycle belonged to Ariyo.

The hoodlums were said to have heard of the arrest of the motorcyclist and mobilised themselves to destroy property and attack people.

It was gathered that the miscreants included ladies and they shot sporadically into the air to scare people who scampered to safety.

They were said to have used clay pots to cover their heads while they unleashed terror on passers-by.

SUNDAY PUNCH learnt that security operatives were later drafted to restore normalcy while fire-fighters from the state fire service battled to quench fire on the property set ablaze.

Another source said the chaos was caused by the alleged refusal of the task force official attached to the mobile court in Ipata area to allow health workers to immunise children in the area even after they properly identified themselves.

The action of the enforcement officer was said to have angered some youths who reportedly attacked the officer and other mobile court and sanitation personnel.

Meanwhile, 36 people were said to have been arrested and arraigned at different mobile courts in Ilorin for committing various environmental offences.

2906,Oyo police kill three robbers,4/23/2015,,Ibadan South-West,Oyo,3,,State Actor,,,,Robber,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,,,,,,Gun,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/oyo-police-kill-three-robbers/,,,7.3407202,3.872819901,"Ibadan South-West, Oyo, Nigeria",Nigeria,": Olufemi Atoyebi

The Oyo State Police Command says three robbers were killed during an exchange of gunfire with some of its men on the Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode Road during a robbery operation.

It was learnt that the shootout occurred around 11pm on Thursday around Idi-Ayunre, after the robbers had attacked one Jayeola Olawuyi and his wife, who ran into their trap along the Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode Road.

Luck however ran out on the robbers as policemen from the Oyo State command rushed to the scene after receiving an intelligence report on the activities of the robbers.

Addressing journalists in Ibadan, Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Olakunle Ajisebutu, who spoke on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, Mohammadu Katsina, said jewellery, guns and other weapons were recovered from the robbers.

He called on hospitals and the public to be on the lookout for anyone with gunshot injuries, who might be looking for help.

He said, “Three members of a gang of itinerant armed robbers that had terrorised traders, commuters, and other road users in the Ibadan-Ijebu-Ode areas were killed on Thursday.

“They had maimed innocent citizens and dispossessed them of their hard-earned money and other valuables.

“Two wooden guns wrapped in black cello-tape, a cutlass, gold jewellery, some cash and two torches were recovered from the robbers. Our men succeeded in killing three of them during a gun duel while others escaped with gunshot injuries.

“This operation was launched with the help of our robust intelligence network of the command’s ambush squad, comprising well-trained personnel from the Idi-Ayunre Police Division. They swooped on the suspected robbers during one of their operations on April 23, 2015 and terminated their existence from the society,” he said.

Narrating their ordeal in the hands of the robbers, the couple said they were travelling from Ibadan to Ijebu-Ode in their Toyota Corolla car when they ran into them.

Olawuyi said he and his wife sustained machete injuries during the attack, and that they were lucky to get help from passersby who took them to a hospital for treatment.

ABOUT 100 suspected Fulani mercenaries late on Saturday and Sunday morning attacked and killed 30 people, mostly women and children, in Guma, Kwande, respecively in Buruku and Keana local government areas of Benue and Nasarawa states.

The PUNCH gathered that the mercenaries attacked Tse-Uosu, Tse-Gbudu Taraka and Branch Umenger villages, all in Mbadwem council ward in the Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.

In Keana, Iornungun village was attacked while in Kwande the attackers terrorised Jato/Aka and environs just as the villagers at Mbatie, Mbatsease and Mbaatungu Aji, all in the Buruku Local Government Area, were displaced by the invaders.

It was learnt that apart from the 19 persons said to have been killed, several others also sustained injuries even as many others in the area had been rendered homeless.

A fleeing native of Guma, identified simply as Suunen, told one of our correspondents that the gunmen stormed the communities “while the villagers were having their rest after the day’s hard work and started shooting at innocent and defenceless people of the area.”

Suunen added that even members of the neighbouring communities had started fleeing their homes because of the fear that the suspected Fulani militias might decide to attack their communities too.

The Benue State police command’s spokesman, Austin Ezeani, confirmed the attacks but said the police were yet to ascertain the number of people that were killed.

Ezeani said the various divisions were yet to give the casualty figures and promised to release the details as they come in.

Another victim, Terungwa, said his mother narrowly escaped from Mbatie and that the woman had been taking refuge in Yandev in the Gboko Local Government Area.

IN Nasarawa State, 11persons were killed on Sunday during an invasion on Uoosu village in the Keana Local Government Area by the suspected Fulani mercenaries.

Apart from killing the 11, the herdsmen also razed Uoosu village and laid ambushed on the Keana-Korta Road, where they shot at people on sight.

Investigations indicated that the problem began when two Fulani herdsmen were allegedly murdered while grazing on a cassava farm belonging to a Tiv man in a village along the Udei-Daudu Road in Benue State.

The PUNCH also learnt that the deceased herdsmen had been nabbed by the local farmers in an attempt to kill the farmers with cutlass.

It was learnt that the attack on Uoosu village by the Fulani was to avenge the death of two of their kinsmen.

The Nasarawa State Police Public Relations Officer, Ismaila Numan, said only three people were killed and that the command had commenced investigation into the incident.

The wounded persons, after the attack, were taken to Apata Police Station where the matter was reported.

It was learnt that Odejobi and his men had allegedly been terrorising the residents of about 28 communities since the past two months over the ownership of the land, claiming his forefather fought wars with the Egba and reclaimed the land in question.

But the Ekerin Olubadan of Ibadanland, who is the head of Foko family, Oyewole, has kicked against Odejobi’s claim.

The Tao FM Radio Station bombed in Kogi State... on Tuesday.

The Acting Inspector-General of Police, Solomon Arase, has ordered increased security presence around media houses in the country.

Arase’s directive followed the bombing of the office of TAO FM, a community radio station, in Okene, Kogi State, on Monday night.

Three people believed to be security men and an engineer were feared killed and many others injured in the incident.

Arase said in a statement on Tuesday by the Force Public Relations Officer, Emmanuel Ojukwu, that his decision was in consonance with the traditional responsibility of the police to protect lives and property.

He added that he was appreciative of the contributions of the media to democratic governance in the country.

The statement read, “The Acting Inspector-General of Police, Solomon Arase, is concerned about the recent attacks on the media houses, and journalists. He has, therefore, ordered water-tight security around media houses nationwide.

“This is in line with the mandate of the Nigeria Police Force to protect lives and property of the citizenry under the law.

“The Acting IG acknowledges the valuable roles of the media to the enthronement of democracy in Nigeria.

“He further advises citizens to be more vigilant and proactive and to report any suspicious movement or persons to the Police promptly for appropriate action.”

The PUNCH gathered on Tuesday morning that two explosions went off at about 7.20pm on Monday on the premises of the station which is located in Kuroko, Adavi Local Government Area in Okene town.

The station is believed to be owned by a former Director-General of the National Broadcasting Commission, Dr. Tom Adaba.

It was gathered that the gunmen,who carried out the attack had on arrival on the premises deceived the security men by pretending to be on a business visit.

A source, who pleaded anonymity said the attack on the station might not be unconnected with its perceived uncompromising stance on some political issues and development in the state.

He added that the station had criticised some politicians for allegedly playing roles that led to violence during Saturday’s House of Assembly re-run election in parts of Kogi Central Senatorial District of the state.

Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, Shola Adebayo, confirmed the death of four people and wounding of many.

He said that the state Commissioner of Police, Samuel Ogunjemilusi, visited the station and ordered a thorough investigation.

Adebayo said, “ There were two explosions in the place at about 7.20pm on Monday. We have cordoned off the place and we tried to evacuate the victims. Three guards at the gate and an engineer died in the blasts. Many people were injured but no arrest has been made. We are still investigating the incident.”

Many stakeholders like Governor Idris Wada; his deputy, Yomi Awoniyi; Ogunjemilusi, Kogi State Coordinator, Buhari/Osibanjo Campaign Organisation, Abdullahi Bello; and the Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Ado Ibrahim, have decried the blasts.

Wada, who spoke through his Special Adviser on Communication and Strategy, Edi Jacob, sympathised with the families of the dead and injured victims.

He called on security agencies to ensure a comprehensive investigation of the blasts and arrest of the culprits.

Awoniyi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Michael Abu, decried the bombings as shocking, barbaric and unimaginable.

He said the station had since its establishment been known for its balanced reportage and promotion of peace and unity in the senatorial district.

Bello, a former Speaker of the state, said the station was professional and forthright in its reportage and analysis of issues in the state.

While commiserating with the families of the victims , he urged the management of the station not to be deterred by the attack.

He said, “The radio came on board when all of us needed to hear about ourselves and we needed to change our behaviours, attitudes and orientation towards one another.

“The government and security agencies should investigate properly, find the culprits and the motives behind their action.

“I am appealing to the management of the radio station not to be deterred. They should continue in the good work they are doing.”

Ibrahim, who was also on the premises of the station, said the explosions would not be allowed to recur in the town.

He said, “This attack is a complete shame to the entire Ebiraland and the state government . This radio station has been serving the people as its members of staff have done what we did not expect in the area of sensitising the community to how best to live together in harmony.

“The station is never biased in its reportage; so I wonder why somebody would think of harming the people working there.

“Enough of these killings on this land. As a traditional ruler I will not allow this issue to be swept under the carpet. The perpetrator of this heinous act must be uncovered.”

It was learnt that the late barber, simply identified as Patrick, was accosted by his assailants in front of his shop and shot at a close range.

Another man was reportedly killed ‎at about 7am, at Second East Circular road, in Benin, the state capital.

A 65-year-old wood seller, Mrs. Philomena Evbuomwan, who witnessed the barber’s death, said the gunmen shot their victim in the head and chest and ensured that he was dead before they left.

Evbuomwan added that she was threatened by the gunmen, who pointed a gun at her.

‎She said, “I was selling wood when Patrick greeted me. I later sat with him. Suddenly, three boys walked towards us.

“One pointed a gun at my head and later dropped it. He shot Patrick; the other one also fired a shot.

“The third person took his gun and tapped Patrick. When he saw that he was dead, they ran away. After that, I fainted.”

This brings to six the number persons said to have been killed by suspected cultists, four of which were reportedly shot dead last weekend.

It was gathered that the cult clashes might be a fallout of a scuffle at one of the polling units in the state capital, during the March 28 election, which led to the death of a member of one of the cult groups.

The Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Stephen Onwochei, could, however, not be reached for comments on the incidents as of the time of filing this report."

Gunmen have kidnapped a physiotherapist attached to the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, UPTH, Dr (Mrs.) Oju Onotai.

Onotai was kidnapped on her way to work at the UPTH Monday morning, even as the hoodlums are demanding a ransom of N50 million before releasing her.

Meanwhile, the Nigeria Society of Physiotherapists has called on the police and other security agencies to put extra-effort in rescuing their member.

Chairman of the society in the state, Dr. Apollos Akomako, who confirmed the kidnap, expressed surprise that doctors have now become a target for kidnappers.

He said: “What is happening in Rivers State now is unfortunate. Why would doctors who are rendering selfless services to members of the society become target of kidnappers?

“I am also surprised that they (kidnappers) are demanding for N50 million to free her. I use this opportunity to call on the police and other security agencies to rise to the occasion and ensure her early release.�?

Akomaku expressed regret that doctors were being targeted for kidnap despite the selfless services they render to members of the public.

He also appealed to the abductors to release her unconditionally.

Doctors have become targets of kidnap in recent times in the state with over four abducted, while one of them died in kidnappers’ den.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Ahmad Mohammad could not be reached to confirm the abduction, as he did not pick calls put across to his mobile phone."

No fewer than 70 persons were said to have lost their lives and several others injured in separate attacks in Karim Lamido and Takum Local Government Areas of Taraba State within the past few days.

It was alleged that 27 people were killed in Karim-Lamido LGA following a reprisal by the military.

The PUNCH gathered that suspected Fulani gunmen ambushed and killed six soldiers while three were said to be missing two days ago when the gunmen attacked the soldiers between Amar and Kambari village of Karim Lamido LGA.

The soldiers were said to be on a routine patrol of the area when they were ambushed and killed.

Three of the missing soldiers were also found dead by the military when they combed the area in search of their missing colleagues.

In Takum LGA, 21 people were killed on Sunday by suspected Kuteb youths, who were said to be on a revenge mission after about 13 of their people were alleged to have been killed along Takum-Katsina-Ala and Takum-Kashinbilla roads between Friday and Saturday by yet-to-be-identified gunmen.

It was gathered that while the soldiers were in search of three of their missing colleagues in Karim Lamido, suspected gunmen opened fire on them and the military replied, leaving over 27 persons dead.

Chairman of Karim Lamido LGA, Bobboi Bello Bendu, could not confirm the number of casualties, but said there was an exchange of fire in the area.

He said, “Two villages were completed razed, but I can’t tell the exact number of casualties at the moment. The report I am getting indicates that some persons were killed.”

There were reports that trucks, loaded with soldiers from Taraba and the neighbouring Adamawa state, stormed the area two days ago to search for their missing colleagues.

A military source, who pleaded anonymity, said they recovered two bodies of their missing colleagues and were looking for the remaining one when gunmen opened fire on them.

He added that they defended themselves and in the process, many of the attackers were killed. But locals said, over 27 people were killed.

Tension is said to be mounting in Takum town and its environs as the Kuteb youths are reported to be hunting and killing Tiv people, who they alleged killed 13 of their people.

Following the development, the council chairman Mr. Caleb Babafi, imposed a 24-hour curfew in Takum town to forestall the breakdown of law of order in the area.

Confirming the killings, Police Public Relations Officer, Joseph Kwaji, said he was not aware of the killings in Karim Lamido, but said nine people were killed in Takum following clashes between Tiv and Kuteb."

The issuance of Certificate of Return to lawmakers-elect in Osun State was almost marred by violence on Monday, as some hoodlums attacked a lawmaker-elect from Ife East Constituency, Mr. Akinwole Akinwale.

The lawmaker-elect was about leaving the state office of the Independent National Electoral Commission when some miscreants waylaid him and prevented him from leaving the venue.

Our correspondent observed that there was a brief fight at the gate of the INEC, but the crisis was quickly resolved.

Akinwole later told our correspondent on the telephone that those who attacked him were sent by a former commissioner from Ife.

He said that he had been told that he would not be allowed to collect the Certificate of Return but he did not take the warning seriously.

He said, “I was attacked by some boys who said that the former commissioner had said I should not be allowed to take the certificate. I was told he asked them to shoot me if I insisted on collecting it.

“I was attacked while coming out of the INEC office and they tore my clothes. The policemen who were there tried to rescue me and I was ferried out of the place in the Speaker’s car.”

Earlier, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, advised the lawmakers-elect to set aside their political differences and work together to move the state forward.

The REC urged the legislators-elect not to betray the trust reposed in them by the electorate who voted for them.

Responding, lawmakers-elect said they were ready to work for the development of the state, irrespective of their party affiliation.

The Deputy Speaker of Osun State House of Assembly, Mr. Akintunde Adegboye, who spoke on behalf of the 24 lawmakers elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, lauded the Speaker, Mr. Najem Salam, for the way he had led the assembly for the past four years.

The PDP lawmaker-elect from Ife Central, Mr. Oladejo Makinde, lauded the INEC for being fair in the conduct of the election.

He said that the lawmakers-elect were friends and would unite to move the state forward.

A priest in the Roman Catholic Church, Rev. Father Innocent Umor, has been kidnapped in Kogi State.

The victim, who oversees Ikanepo Parish, Ankpa Local Government Area, Idah Diocese of Kogi State, was kidnapped on Monday, according to another Catholic priest, who identified himself simply as Rev Father Hyacinth, while speaking to journalists.

He stated that the suspected kidnappers, numbering about five, stormed the parish at about 2.10am, on Monday with guns and took the victim to an unknown place.

Hyacinth said the kidnappers, after several hours after the abduction, called the Bishop of the Diocese, Bishop Anthony Adaji, with the victim’s cell phone, and demanded N4m ransom.

Commissioner of Police, Kogi State Command, Mr Samuel Ogunjemilusi, confirmed the abduction.

He said the incident was reported to him by his officers at the victim’s area as well as from the Bishop of the Diocese.

He stated that he had mobilised the anti-kidnap squad of the command, adding that efforts had been intensified to rescue the victim unharmed.

Ogunjemilusi said, “I have been informed of the incident by men on the ground and the Bishop of the Diocese.

“The kidnappers entered the Rev. Father’s house at about 2.10am. I have already deployed men of the anti-kidnap squad of my command to ensure the safe release of the abducted Rev. Father. No body or group had claimed responsibility for the criminal act.”"

Director, Defence Information, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade

The troops of the Nigerian Army repelled an ambush by the Boko Haram insurgents on Sunday night.

Investigations revealed that the insurgents ambushed the troops while they were on their way to Sambisa Forest to reinforce military presence in the area.

An intelligence personnel, who confided in our correspondent, said that the soldiers killed an unspecified number of the insurgents in a gun duel.

It was learnt that the troops, who belong to the 81 Battalion of the Nigerians Army, Ibadan, were ordered to move from their location in Sector 8, Maiduguri, when they ran into the ambush.

The source said that a soldier died in the attack while three others who were injured had been rushed to a hospital in Maiduguri for treatment.

“The terrorists attacked our men but they were repelled. I can’t give the exact number of those killed but I can tell you that many of the terrorists were killed.

“On the side of the military, we lost one soldier. The three other injured soldiers have been rushed to the hospital in Maiduguri where they are being treated,” the source said.

When our correspondent contacted the Director, Defence Information, Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, he neither confirmed nor denied the attack.

Olukolade said that some of the Boko Haram members fleeing from the ongoing onslaught might want to carry out some mischievous acts which the military had the capacity to respond to in a decisive manner.

He said, “Much as I don’t want to confirm or deny what you are asking, let me say that those terrorists on flight might want to do mischief.

“However, let me say that the military has the capacity to deal decisively with such elements.”

2930,Police attack journalists during Niger Assembly impeachment saga,5/5/2015,Minna,Chanchaga,Niger,0,,State Actor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,Other,,,Government Building,,,,,,,http://www.punchng.com/news/police-attack-journalists-during-niger-assembly-impeachment-saga/,,,9.6125803,6.543499947,"Chanchaga, Niger, Nigeria",Nigeria,": Enyioha Opara, Minna

Policemen deployed in the Niger State House of Assembly on Tuesday assaulted journalists, who were at thre Assembly complex to cover the unfolding impeachment saga in the state.

On Tuesday morning, the police had locked the gate to prevent members and staff of the Assembly, journalists and guests from entering or going out of the House.

The move, it was learnt, was to prevent the lawmakers from forming a quorum to move for the impeachment of the state Governor, Dr. Babangida Aliyu.

It was reliably gathered that the Niger State Assistant Commissioner of Police (Operations), Emmanuel Olokor, ordered that nobody be allowed in or out of the premises as there were feelers that the Mace, the symbol of authority of the Assembly, was missing.

But when the Clerk of the Assembly, Abdullahi Kagara, got to the gate, the Policemen, who barricaded the gate, opened for him but barred journalists, who tried to walk into the complex.

The DPO in charge of the Assembly, ASP Thomas Louis, rushed in and hit the NTA Reporter, Suleiman Kodogi, and Samson Alfa, a reporter with Standard Newspapers.

The policemen also smashed the mobile telephone set of John Ogiji of the Guardian after the pictures he had snapped were deleted by a Police officer.

The PUNCH Correspondent, Enyioha Opara, also lost his wristwatch during the melee.

When the leadership of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, led by the Secretary, Abu Nmodu intervened, the efforts were in futility as all journalists remained locked out on the instruction of Olokor.

Nmodu said, “We, the NUJ, condemn in totality this harassment and intimidation on journalists that are going about their legitimate duties by the Police.

“It is unfortunate that this is coming barely two days after we marked the World Press Freedom Day.”

He however appealed to journalists to conduct themselves peacefully saying, “The Union will pursue the case and ensure there is an end to this continuous harassment.”

The Policemen kept shouting, “We will not open the gate; it is an order from above.”

Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Ibrahim Gambari, said there was no such order that journalists should be barred from the Assembly complex.

“The men at the Assembly complex are on their own; we only asked them to ensure peace and orderliness and not to harass journalists. The Police have the mandate to have good working relationship with pressmen. We cannot infringe on the right of journalists,” Gambari added."

The killing of terror suspects, according to the commander of Vigilante Group, Madu Plungwa, was successful because the fleeing insurgents numbering over three dozens in a convoy of Toyota Hilux vehicles and motorcycles stopped at a fish farm to drink and eat, before proceeding towards the border areas of Yobe and Gombe.

""The fleeing insurgents were ambushed at this fish farm when they stopped to refuel and eat roasted fish on the farm. As some of them relaxed, five hunters, who have taken strategic positions near the fish farm, opened fire at them and killed 29 in the exchange of gunfire.

Some were however, able to flee in the same vehicles with gunshot wounds,"" said Plungwa in a telephone interview with The Guardian yesterday in Maiduguri.

He said the insurgents were fleeing towards the south and southeast flanks of Sambisa Forest, so that they could get access to Yobe and Gombe escape forest routes.

""The fleeing insurgents were desperate to escape, because most of them have run out of arms and ammunitions, which they used to attack various towns and villages in Borno and Adamawa states,"" said the vigilante leader.

Borno Police Command yesterday confirmed the clash between fleeing insurgents and local hunters near Hiang in Hawul council area. ""I cannot provide details of casualties, but when our DPO submits his report on the security situation today or tomorrow (Friday), the command will brief the press,"" said the police source. Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday vowed that government would not relent in the war against the insurgency until the country was safe for all.

Jonathan made this declaration in a message to the newly inducted Batch 'A' members of the National Youth Service Corps deployed in Rivers State. President Jonathan, who expressed delight in the performance of the military in the ongoing battle against Boko Haram, said they (military) have displayed a high level of patriotism.

In a related development, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Nigerian Red Cross have delivered aid to a group of 275 people, mainly women and children, who had been found in Sambisa forest, in north-east Nigeria.

The group was found during military operations in the region last week. The group was taken to a camp in the town of Yola yesterday to receive clothing, bed-sheets, jerri cans and hygiene articles.

The ICRC also provided medical supplies to the federal hospital in Yola to help treat the wounded and sick. President Jonathan expressed confidence that the incoming administration of General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would sustain the support given to corps members in order to achieve the objectives of the scheme.

""Through the patriotic and courageous efforts of our armed forces, combined with the right equipment and strategy, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against insurgency and we will not relent, until all parts of the country are safer for our people and for national service.

""I believe the next government will continue to support and encourage corps members by fulfilling its statutory obligations to the scheme and providing a peaceful atmosphere for optimal performance of corps members wherever they are.

ICRC official in Yola, Beat Armin Mosimann, said ""The suffering endured during this conflict, especially by women and girls, is tragic. Communities have been torn apart.

We hope this group of people can now return to their families and loved ones. They will need continued support into the future."" Mosimann added that the ICRC would further coordinate its efforts with other humanitarian actors to respond to the needs of this group.

The ICRC and the Nigerian Red Cross are engaged in large-scale activities to help the population affected by the conflict in northeast Nigeria. Since December 2014, food has been distributed to more than 200,000 people, clean water has been provided and medical assistance given to the local population and surgical cares in northeastern Nigeria."

Three unidentified women were kidnapped in Ekiti State on Friday afternoon by unknown gunmen.

The women were kidnapped with their husbands and unspecified number of children along Igbole-Igbosin road while travelling in a Toyota RAV 4 Sports Utility Vehicle to Ibadan, Oyo state, for a wedding.

It was gathered that their captors later dropped the men and the children while the women were driven away in the car after collecting the phones and other valuables from the victims.

The husbands and the children were said to be wailing profusely until some sympathisers came to their aid.

The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Alberto Adeyemi, confirmed the report to our correspondent.

“The Divisional Police Officer in Ido called in today to give the report about the kidnapped women. We have already launched investigation into the case but I can’t speak about it,” he said.

The whereabouts of the women remained unknown while contact had not been established with the families as of press time.

No fewer than five people, including a former Chief Medical Director of Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Dr Patrick Adegun; his wife, Kikelomo; a senior nurse at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido Ekiti, Mrs Margaret Aladenika; and a lecturer of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, had been kidnapped in the last two weeks in the state.

Meanwhile, the Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has written the Inspector General of Police, Mr Solomon Arase, calling for his intervention to stem the spate of kidnappings that had hit the state in the last few weeks.

In a May 15 letter, signed by the governor, he requested the IG’s special intervention in removing the fear the people of the state were experiencing following numerous cases of abductions of innocent people.

According to a statement in Ado-Ekiti on Friday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Idowu Adelusi, the governor promised the people that the situation would soon be put under control.

The letter read in part, “It is with great concern that I am appealing to you to help in our quest for a lasting solution to the spate of kidnappings and abductions in our dear state. The development has created fear in the minds of our people and no meaningful development can take place under such atmosphere.

“As a responsible government, we are taking all necessary steps to curtail and put an end to these dastardly acts, and we believe a special attention from your office on the matter to our state, would no doubt, lead to finding a quick solution to the problem.”"

The communities; Tse-Agbulu, Tse-Atakpa and Tse-Abichi among others were besieged by the marauders with sporadic gunshots while many were wounded and dispossessed of their belongings.

According to a source, those who sustained injury from the attack were currently receiving treatment at Naka, headquarters of the local council. The source gave the names of those who were killed as Iorhen Agbulu, Mrs. Anakula Gbesa and Mr. Agboughul Uoor, while Godwin Ahuna was said to be seriously macheted.

Worried by the killing of their people by the herdsmen, President, Tyoshin Development Association, a socio-cultural organisation, Dr. Sylvester Ugbegili in a statement condemned the unprovoked attack and grazing of cattle on farm lands causing damage to crops.

The association said it was high time the Federal Government stopped the unnecessary invasion of the peoples' farms and homes by the herdsmen.

He said, ""The Tyoshin people are bonafide citizens of this country and must not be treated as aliens. The Fulani people should be instructed to stop off the Tyoshin land; hence it is entirely for farming activity"".

However, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO Austin Ezeani who confirmed the clash, said only one person was killed; even as he added that normalcy had returned to the area. It will be recalled that communities in the area have suffered from innumerable attacks on their citizens by Fulani herdsmen since 2011."

The PUNCH gathered that the gunmen, numbering more than 10, who were said to be in a Toyota car, opened fire indiscriminately at the people at the drinking joint. Their intention was not known.

Despite imposition of dusk to dawn curfew on Ado Ekiti, unknown arsonists in the early of yesterday attacked the popular Erekesan Market opposite the palace of the Ewi of Ado Ekiti and set ablaze a section.

Residents of the state capital woke up yesterday to behold thick clouds bellowing from the market and the charred remains of the burnt shops. No fewer than 50 shops and two residential buildings went up in flames in the incidence as efforts of the state Fire Services to put out the midnight fire were to no avail.

Trouble started in the capital city on Wednesday when the standoff between drivers’ union and butchers developed to a full blown violence with Hausa traders fighting on the side of the butchers. In the ensuing violence where dangerous weapons were freely used, many shops including the stores of the Hausa traders were torched and looted with many persons injured.

As part of effort to douse the tension building up between the two warring sides and to avert reprisal attacks, the state governor on Thursday, imposed a 6am to 6pm curfew till further notice on the state capital with orders to the police and other security agencies to arrest anybody found roaming the streets during the period.

The police also claimed they had deployed two units of mobile policemen to the affected area to ensure peace and as well prevent breakdown of law and order in the area.

Sources at the area yesterday said they suspected the Hausa residents of responsibility for the razing down of the section populated mainly by Yoruba traders as revenge for the loss they (Hausa) suffered during the attack on Wednesday.

While owners of the affected stalls and sympathizers were seen wailing and counting their losses, owners of shops in other sections were seen evacuating their stores.

Evacuation of shops began on Wednesday following the destruction and looting visited on the market. Following the development, most schools in the state capital could not open their gate to pupils while others had to hurriedly send back school children to their different homes.

Banks and other business outfits also shut down their gates to businesses as heavy deployment of antiriot policemen and soldiers to the area was witnessed just as security checks on vehicles and passers-by intensified on the orders of the state government to prevent escalation of the crisis and prevent massive looting.

A number of residents were also randomly arrested by men of the state police command in connection with the development. The state governor, who personally led security team that included the newly posted Commissioner of Police, Mr Etop James, to the scene, expressed worry at the turn of event despite his imposition of dusk to dawn curfew.

The governor called for reinforcement of security at the flashpoints"

AT least 21 suspected cult members were killed by operatives of the Rivers State Anti-Robbery Squad in Egi community of Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area.

A source from the community explained that the incident happened in the wee hours of Thursday in a forest located between Egi and Egburu.

It was gathered that security operatives, who got wind of the hideout of the cultists, stormed the forest and opened fire on them.

The team that stormed the bush was said to have left the corpses of the suspected cultists in the bush while permitting the deceased relatives to get their bodies there.

It will be recalled that Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni had in recent times been the centre of most cult-related killings, with scores of people losing their lives before and during the 2015 elections.

Another source, who preferred not to be mentioned, told Saturday PUNCH that three suspected cult members were arrested by the police on Friday morning in the area.

However, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Muhammad, who was contacted to confirm the report, said he was not aware of the incidents.

Meanwhile, ahead of today’s (Saturday) local government election, the State Police Command has announced the restriction of movement from 10pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday.

A statement signed by the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, also said that the restriction of movement would continue from 9am to 6pm on Saturday.

Mohammad explained that the restriction of movement was declared by the police command to pave the way for a smooth council poll in the state on Saturday (today).

He said, “The Rivers State Police Command wishes to inform the general public that ahead of the Rivers State Local Government election that is scheduled to hold on Saturday, May 23, 2015, it has ordered a restriction of movement of vehicles across the state between 10pm on Friday, May 22, 2015 till 6am on Saturday May 23, 2015 in the first lap, and finally between 9am and 6pm on Saturday, May 23, 2015.

“The restriction is aimed at ensuring peace and serenity across the state before, during and after the local government election.”

But the Peoples Democratic Party in the state said the Nigeria Police acted overzealously by imposing a �?curfew’ in the state on account of the �?illegal’ local government election.

The state PDP in a statement signed by the Special Adviser, Media to its chairman, Mr. Jerry Needam, said the All Progressives Congress-led government in the state was purportedly conducting the council election.

He said, “The police cannot be crying more than the bereaved as there is no security threat or any breach of public order that will justify the imposition of a curfew in Rivers State at this time.

“Even during the last general elections with heightened competition and tension at that time, the police did not impose a curfew, wondering why the curfew at a more robust peace period and coming at a time the court stripped the election of legitimacy.

“It amounts to double standards for the police to aid illegality because they are a defendant as well as the INEC in the suit where the Federal High Court judge ordered parties to maintain status quo regarding the release of voter registers.”

“To conduct an election without the voter register, the main ingredient of legitimacy in the election, is a slap to the court. The police should be law enforcers and not law breakers,” the statement added.

There was pandemonium in Uselu Secondary School, Benin, on Thursday when some armed men stormed the school premises and abducted one of the teachers.

It was gathered that the gunmen arrived the school, located in Egor Local Government Area of the state, in a vehicle at a‎bout 12.05pm and shot sporadically into the air, forcing the students to run in different directions.

It was learnt that they later forced the teacher into the vehicle, after stabbing three of the students, who tried to prevent the men from abducting their teacher.

Our correspondent learnt ‎that the affected students, who sustained cuts in the chest, head and arm, were later rushed to an undisclosed hospital.

The students were, however, thrown into wild jubilation when the abducted teacher returned to the school premises, when our correspondent arrived at the school at about 2pm.

The teacher, who identified him‎self as Iguodala Chosen, said the gunmen told him that he was taken away over a fight between two students in the school but was later released by the leader of the group.

‎He said, “One of them said he was a soldier, so, I simply followed him. Then they started hitting me. When I asked them what I had done wrong, they said that it was because of the fight between two students.

“I told them that the Principal had intervened in the issue. Then they took me to National Youth Council at Slope, but their chairman pleaded with me not to be annoyed over how I was beaten and released me.”

Efforts to reach the Edo State Police Command on the matter were unsuccessful."

The immediate past deputy governor of Adamawa state, Hon. Sa’ad Tahir, was attacked at the inauguration of the new governor, Bindow Jibrilla, on Friday.

Tahir, who represented the former state governor, Mr. Bala Ngilari, at the handing over ceremony was attacked by some irate crowd at the event.

Irate youths at the ceremony held at Mahmud Ribadu Square in Yola, the state capital, also manhandled and damaged the car of a serving senator, Alhaji Bello Tukur, who was rescued by security operatives and whisked out of the venue.

Before the attack on Tukur, he was intermittently booed by the crowd at the event venue while delivering the governor’s speech.

He was pelted with shoes and sachets of water before being immediately whisked off the podium by security operatives.

The angry crowd also asked for Ngilari, threatening to stone him as well.

The angry crowd recited songs in Hausa language interpreted as “It was all lies. We don’t want you; shut up! Your time is over; PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) killed our nation.”

It took the intervention of APC party chieftains to calm down the crowd as security operatives attached to Tahir had to whisk him away.

Tahir had earlier in his speech said that the outgone administration was able to achieve a lot in the areas of fighting insurgency, education and youth empowerment with the call on the incoming government to improve on the situation. In his inaugural speech, Jibrilla assured the people that he would run an open door policy.

He said Adamawa was among the most backward states in the country, adding that he was optimistic that the situation would improve with prayers and commitment.

Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose

Some thugs loyal to Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, on Wednesday descended on The PUNCH Correspondent in Ekiti State, Kamarudeen Ogundele, beating him to stupor while on official duty.

The thugs, who continued to lay siege to the House of Assembly Complex and all roads leading to the state capital, attacked him around noon on Bank Road, very close to a road-block mounted by the police near the Assembly complex.

He had gone to gauge the mood in town when the thugs descended on him for trying to take the picture of women praying for peace in the state, about 200 metres away from the Assembly complex.

Many of the loyalists of the governor and members of the Peoples Democratic Party lined up all the major streets leading to the complex to prevent the 19 APC lawmakers from gaining entry to the assembly to actualise their move to impeach Fayose.

His dress was torn into shreds by the hoodlums who were angry with him for taking picture after seizing his phone.

He said, “I was about leaving the place when I saw the women praying for peace to reign in the state. I felt it was a spiritual approach to the trouble in the state, so I decided to take the picture. The thugs emerged from their hideouts and swooped on me.

“I kept shouting ‘I’m a journalist’ but they did not show me mercy as they pounced on me. They were like 50 persons kicking me all at the same time. They dragged me out of the car and continued hitting me. At a time, one of them went to carry a big plank of wood in an attempt to hit my head.

“Two policemen raced to the scene to intervene but they were overwhelmed by the mob. One of the policemen started shouting, ‘run, run, run, don’t let them kill you!’ I thought the end had come because they continued beating me. Luckily for me, a few among them felt they had beaten me enough and started fighting their colleagues to let me go. I capitalised on their disagreement and with the help of the police, I quickly escaped.”

The governor later called one of the leaders of the Nigerian Union of Journalist in the state to apologise for his supporters’ action. He also expressed regret over the mob action.

While condemning the incident, Fayose said the action of the overzealous men should not be taken for action of his government.

He assured journalists that they would be guaranteed freedom to discharge their duties without fear or favour in the state, and without intimidation from any quarter.

Meanwhile, riot policemen took over the Efon Alaaye, the border town of Ekiti State with Osun State, where some supporters of the PDP had prevented free vehicular movement on Tuesday.

2997,Kogi mob burns police patrol van over pedestrian’s death,6/3/2015,Obehira ,Okene,Kogi,0,,,,,,,Other,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,,,,,,,,Other,,http://www.punchng.com/news/kogi-mob-burns-police-patrol-van-over-pedestrians-death/,,,7.5542498,6.233029842,"Okene, Kogi, Nigeria",Nigeria,": Success Nwogu, Ilorin

No fewer that 20 unidentified youths on Wednesday attacked and burnt a police patrol vehicle at Obehira area, Okene Local Government Area of Kogi State.

The youths, who are mostly youths, were said to have accused the police of causing the death of an innocent man who was hit by a fleeing motorist.

A source told journalists in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, that the police patrol vehicle was pursuing a vehicle suspected to be conveying India Hemp along the Obehira road.

He added that in the process, the vehicle hit a passerby, who fell into a gutter.

The source said the occupants of the vehicle escaped before the police could get to the scene.

He alleged that when the police arrived the scene, they felt unconcerned about the injured person, but were allegedly more interested only in impounding the vehicle conveying the illicit substance.

According to him, the youths became enraged at the perceived police inhumanity.

The youths were said to have demanded that the police ensure the victim was treated before taking the vehicle to police station.

The source said the disagreement between the police and the youths degenerated into a face-off.

The police were said to have escaped from the scene to avoid the anger of the mob, leaving behind their patrol vehicle and the one conveying the banned substance.

The source said the youths later burnt the two vehicles.

Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Collins Adebayo, confirmed the burning of the vehicles.

He stated that the police got a distress call that a red Honda Accord was carrying an exhibit.

The PPRO added that when the driver saw the police, he fled with the vehicle.

According to him, in an attempt to escape, he had a burst tyre and in the process, he hit and killed a pedestrian.

Adebayo added that the driver of the vehicle escaped while the youth later attacked the vehicle in anger.

He claimed that the police later arrived at the scene and made attempts to stop the mob from further vandalising the vehicle.

The police spokesman alleged that the youth attacked the police vehicle and later burnt the two cars.

Adebayo said normalcy had returned to the area while investigation was ongoing."

No fewer than six people were killed and properties worth millions of naira were destroyed in a communal clash that broke out between two rival groups in Igbokoda, the headquarters of Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State.

It was gathered that the incident which occurred on Monday involved supporters of the Olu of Igbokoda, Oba Afolabi Odidiomo, and loyalists of a group led by Tale Iwatan.

Oba Odidiomo, who confirmed this on Wednesday, alleged that the Tale Group led by Iwatan had constituted a terror gang in the community.

He called on the state government and security agencies to check the activities of the gang.

According to him, those killed in the attack were Deji Enikanologbon, Ireayo Nana, and three other friends of one Banji Orofin who was allegedly kidnapped and killed by Tale group.

The monarch explained that the group had allegedly killed and raped many women in the town while houses of those who dared the group had allegedly been burnt.

Odidiomo explained that the rival group allegedly started the crisis on Monday following the abduction of Banji Orofin who was taken to a forest known as Tale Sambisa Forest, after which a search party including the police went to rescue him.

He said, “Because we know what this group can do, we send a car to take the people from the forest but they were ambushed by the Tale boys who set them ablaze together with the jeep.”

He alleged that the group was being sponsored by some leaders within the area.

“I want to appeal to the godfathers of these boys to stop fuelling crisis in the area. I know a 33-year-old boy cannot have money to buy and keep such a large armory and sophisticated weapons,” the traditional said .

However, the Tale group alleged that the violence was masterminded by the monarch.

They claimed that the monarch had sent hoodlums to the Iwatan family house with guns and other dangerous weapons. They added that the hoodlums allegedly set two houses belonging to the Iwatan’s family ablaze, when they could not abduct Tale Iwatan.

Counsel for the Tale Group, Mr. Koboju Atima, who spoke on behalf of the family, alleged that two vehicles belonging to the Iwatan family members were burnt by the hoodlums loyal to the monarch.

A fierce and violent clash over the ownership of a farmland at the weekend claimed the lives of two persons in Poshiya village, Billiri local council of Gombe State.

Those killed in the clash were the Academic Dean of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) Theoligical Seminary, Kufai in Poshiya Village, Reverend Emmanuel Joshua and the Librarian of the school, Agabus Abona, heightening tension among surrounding communities.

When journalists visited Poshiya village at the weekend, it was a ghost of itself as all the villagers had abandoned their abode for fear of another attack from their opponents, a community sharing boarder with them in Shongom local council of the state.

Investigations revealed that trouble started Thursday morning when Reverend Joshua sent some women to go and clear a farmland for him to cultivate crops when they were sent away by the Shongom people. It was gathered that when the reverend later went to the farm to find out what the matter was, he was ambushed on the way and hacked by the assailants.

It was also in the clash that, the librarian of the ECWA Seminary, which is located in Kufai, Poshiya Village was also killed while another person who sustained injuries was still at the hospital receiving treatment.

The State Deputy Governor, Charles Iliya, who immediately visited the affected communities to calm down the rising tension pleaded with the people to embrace peace.

He told newsmen at Poshiya that the incident was unfortunate and that mobile policemen had already been drafted to the area to avoid further clashes. He said Ggvernment is determined not to see a repeat of such ugly incident and asked the community leaders to particularly prevail on youths to sheathe their swords.

However, the paramount ruler of the Songom and the Mai Kaltungo, Saleh Mohammed, blamed the occurrence of such clashes on the negligence of chairmen of local government areas who he said have not been performing their duties as the chief security officers of their local governments.

He said since January 2 when such incidents started rearing their ugly head between Lalaipido village in Shongom LGA and Todi village in Billiri LGA, he advised the Chairman of Shongom to see the Chairman of Billiri over an amicable settlement of the matter but all fell on deaf ears.

In the same vein, the Village Head (Dagaci) of Poshiya, Mr. Dedan Kamasco told reporters that they have documents from a court ruling, which indicates that the area in question belongs to them.

Sunday Mirror reliably gathered that this has been an annual occurrence in many farming communities of Southern Gombe State when the farming season sets in. It was also gathered that the rising population and increase in migration of people is a factor responsible for the regular occurrence of such clashes between these farming communities."

Michael Olugbode



The deadly Boko Haram sect attacked a Yobe town, Babbangida, in Tarmuwa local council of the state on Sunday morning, razing many of the houses, a resident, Sule Ibrahim, said on phone.



Babbangida is the headquarters of Tarmuwa Local Government Area of the state and shares borders with Damaturu, the Yobe state capital.



Located 50 kilometres north of Damaturu, it has experienced several cases of Boko Haram invasion in the past.



Ibrahim, who fled to Damaturu as a result of the attack, said ""The Boko Haram militants in the early hours of today invaded the town.""



He said the militants had on Saturday attempted to attack the town but it was thwarted by the military who were alerted.



Ibrahim said: “Yesterday (Saturday) being the market day, there were apprehensions of possible attack on the town but security forces were fully aware and such possible attack was thwarted.”



He said residents equally ran out of their homes and took refuge in the bushes for fear of the attack as the militants reorganised at night and launched an attack on the town around 6:40 am today (Sunday).



“As we were hidden in bushes like many other residents in the early hours of today (Sunday) we then heard several gunshots and chanting of war songs around the troubled Babbangida town confirming the earlier apprehensions and not quite long we saw thick smoke around the town which is gave a strong signal that houses and other structures were being burnt”



He said he attempted to call some of the people in the town after he fled but could not get connected, indicating that the GSM masks might have been destroyed in the area.



A top military personnel, who does not want his name mentioned as he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the attack on Babbangida was a reprisal one as the combined security forces had on Saturday launched an offensive on the insurgents at their hideout around Sasawa, a border town between Damaturu and Babbangida.



“We carried out an offensive attack on the militants as a result of a tip-off. We gathered that they were preparing to attack Damaturu, the state capital, and the attack on Tarmuwa may have been carried out as a reprisal to our earlier assaults,” the source said.



According to the source, Sunday’s attack on Babbangida was unprecedented as damage to property may be huge while the extent of destruction is yet to be determined because GSM services are completely down in the town while thick smoke was sighted from a far.



Sunday's attack is the second in the state since President Muhammadu Buhari took over as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.



The insurgents had earlier attacked Fika and Ngalda towns of Yobe state located west of Damaturu, the state capital."

Gunmen, on Friday, stormed the residence of the National General Secretary of the Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide, Mr. Bristol Alagbariya, and killed one of his aides.

It was gathered that the gunmen, suspected to be assassins, had shot and killed Alagbariya’s personal assistant, simply identified as Silver, after realising that their target, the IYC general secretary, could not be found.

The incident, which took place along Ada George, in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, scared passersby and other occupants of the building.

A source told Southern City News that Silver was later found in a pool of his blood few minutes after the gunmen left.

The source said, “Hired assassins with AK 47 numbering about four, on Friday invaded the residence of the National General Secretary of Ijaw Youths Council Worldwide, Engr. Emmanuel Bristol Alagbariya, brutally murdered one of his personal assistants in cold blood and scaring the life out of everyone they met after realizing that the target man was not around.

“The IYC general secretary, who has been fully engrossed in preparation for an upcoming Rivers Ijaw Summit in commemoration of the 58th year of the Henry Willink’s Minority Commission and celebration of some revered heroes for their selfless contributions towards the recognition of Niger Delta, was said to have convened a meeting of the Rivers Ijaw summit organising committee at his residence.

“While committee members were waiting for him to join them, a bus belonging to the National Secretary drove into the compound and was swiftly followed by the assassins who were all along laying siege outside his compound.”

He added, “They surrounded everyone believing that the national secretary was in the bus, but to their disappointment, their target was nowhere to be found. In that frustration, they proceeded to the room where the committee members were about to meet and ordered everyone to lie flat.

“It was at this moment that one of the gun crazy assailants, for unverifiable reason, decided to shoot and kill the personal assistant to Alagbariya,” the source added.

A statement sent to Southern City News via electronic mail, disclosed that security had been beefed up around Alagbariya while the Rivers Ijaw Summit would still hold as planned in Port Harcourt.

Speaking on the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, said investigation began immediately the report of the killing of Alagbariya’s aide reached the command.

AT least, 35 persons were killed and scores injured when Boko Haram insurgents attacked Nannawaji village, in the Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State and Debiro, in the Hawul Local Government Area of Borno State on Tuesday.

In Yobe, a female suicide bomber detonated an Improvised Explosive Devices strapped on her at a market in Nannawaji.

No fewer than 15 persons were killed in the attack while 26 others sustained injuries, Yusuf Ibrahim, a resident of the village, told our correspondent on the phone.

Ibrahim, who said that he accompanied the injured persons to the hospital in Damaturu, the state capital, narrated, “Though I cannot give you the actual figure of the dead, but I counted 15 corpses when we were running away as we were afraid that there could be more suicide bombers around.

“Some of us even felt that the insurgents might have used the suicide bomber as a strategy to destabilise us before launching an attack.”

He added that he and the others were able to assist those that were injured, taking them to Damaturu Specialists Hospital, where he said the injured had been receiving treatment.

He said the suicide bomber attacked the market around 10:30 a.m.

“But one thing I can tell you for sure is that 26 victims have been taken to the Damaturu Specialists Hospital where they are currently receiving treatment,” Ibrahim said.

As of the time of this report, security agents were yet to confirm the attack but the Chief Medical Director of the Damaturu Specialists Hospital, Dr. Garba Fika, who spoke to journalists, said 26 injured victims of the attack had been brought to the hospital for treatment.

The CMD said three out of the 26 had been taken to the theatre and that three or four others might be referred to medical facilities in Nguru and Azare in Bauchi State or the Aminu Kano Hospital in Kano.

Tuesday’s suicide bomb attack was the first major attack in Yobe since the commencement of the Ramadan fast seven days ago.

In the attack on Debiro in Borno State, 20 persons were reportedly killed as the insurgents stormed the village on motorcycles and Sport Utility Vehicles.

A fleeing resident told our correspondent on the telephone from Maiduguri on Tuesday that the insurgents arrived in the village on Monday and shot several people as well as slit the throat of many.

The source said, “It was in the afternoon time when we started hearing gunshots and people were running, there was confusion everywhere; some were shot dead and many had their throats slit.

“Our foodstuffs were equally carted away by the hoodlums. I cannot tell you sincerely the exact number of people killed but I lost count after counting 20 people, male and female, brutally murdered.”

Debiro is a remote village located in the southern part of Borno. It is about 246 kilometres away from Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.

Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers on Wednesday killed two policemen and abducted two Lebanese nationals in Bayelsa State.

The incident occurred at the riverside town of Onuegbum in Ogbia Local Government Area of the state.

The identities of the slain policemen attached to a construction firm, Pache, dredging sand in the area, could not be immediately ascertained.

The deceased policemen were said to be a Sergeant and Corporal.

But the Lebanese were identified as Sarki Abi Chmouli and Ibrahim Abi Pherem.

Eyewitnesses said the invaders, numbering eight and armed with dangerous assault rifles, stormed the company, a few metres away from the community, about 12.30pm through the waterways in two speedboats.

The gunmen were said to have repeatedly shot sporadically into the air to whittle down any possible resistance.

It was learnt that during the encounter, the policemen were shot by the invading gunmen, who also succeeded in kidnapping the two Lebanese.

The gunmen were said to have escaped through the waterways.

Confirming the incident, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Asinim Butswat, said the corpse of the slain policemen had been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre for autopsy.

Mrs. Patience Jonathan

A Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tamuno Jacob Igbomie, who was Principal Security Officer to former First Lady, Patience Jonathan, has been shot dead by unknown assailants.

Igbomie’s corpse was found in his Honda Accord car last Friday along the Airport Road, Abuja.

The former PSO, who was married with two children, was believed to have been killed by assassins who shot him at point-blank range in his car and left the engine running.

A source said the body of the DSP was found early in the morning with all his phones, wallet and other personal effects intact in the car.

“He was shot in the night and his body was found early in the morning. We don’t know if he was killed over a business transaction or disagreement with someone,” the source who served with the deceased at the villa stated.

It was gathered that the deceased, who hailed from Okrika, Bayelsa State, was serving at the Federal Capital Territory Police Command before he was deployed to the Presidential Villa as Aide-De-Camp to Patience when her husband was the Vice President.

He was later appointed as the PSO to Patience when her husband became the President in 2011.

Findings indicated that the late policemen had just been redeployed back to his former position at the FCT Police Command, where he was in charge of posting of junior officers.

The Force Public Relations Officer, Emmanuel Ojukwu, confirmed the killing of the policeman, noting that investigation has begun to arrest the assailants.

A group of gunmen on Wednesday stormed the Secretariat of the Nigeria Civil Service Union in Port Harcourt and carted away millions of Naira, laptops, phones and other property belonging to workers.

The hoodlums had gone straight to the offices of the chairman, secretary and auditor of the union, ransacking everywhere.

State Chairman of the Nigeria Civil Service Union, Opulabo Lily-West, said the armed robbers beat up his auditor and stole monies amounting to millions of Naira, including electronic gadgets.

“The miscreants invaded this office armed with all manner of dangerous weapons; forced themselves in, beat up my auditor and shattered my office and stole items from my office and that of the executive secretary.

“They stormed the place, carted away files, documents, personal effects running into millions of Naira. They took the N230,000 that was in my drawer. The hoodlums carted away the monies with which we were paying rebate to our officers.

“Other items, which were in my drawer were all carted away,” Lily-West said.

Speaking on the incident, Chairman of the Rivers State Joint Public Negotiating Council, Emecheta Chukwu, called on the police to investigate, arrest and prosecute the bandits.

Chukwu, who paid a solidarity visit to the chairman of the union, said, “What happened here today is a clear case of armed robbery.

“As a body, we condemn this invasion in its totality. This is not what labour unionism is known for. The labour union is a peaceful movement.

“We equally want to urge the police to properly investigate what led to this unprovoked attack, arrest all those involved and prosecute them.

In addition to that, the herdsmen who were grazing the cows could not be found, so early morning of yesterday; we went to the village to search for the missing herdsmen. We later found a body of the missing herdsmen; we are still in search of five missing Fulani herdsmen up till this moment.

“But while our men were conducting the search, some Berom youths re-grouped and attacked the STF men, they shot three soldiers who were on peace keeping mission. Two of the men shot are in critical condition, but the other one is stable. “Now, our frustration as soldiers on national assignment is that why are the people we are protecting attacking soldiers. That has been the habit of the people of this local government, especially people of Barkin Ladi. Why should we be subject of attack” Iweha queried."

No fewer than two students were killed when gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen invaded a school in Barakn Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State.

Sunday Punch gathered that the suspected Fulani terrorists from Bisichi village of Barakinladi LGA attacked Dalo Memorial High School around Hiepang, in B/Ladi LGA of Plateau State on Saturday at about 1pm.

Executive Director of Stefanos Foundation, Mr. Mark Lipdo, said the terrorists shot two students, killing one and injuring the other. The herdsmen were also said to have also shot and killed a farmer on his farm and escaped into Bisichi village.

But the Media Officer of the Special Task Force, Capt. Ikedichi Iweha, said the Foron communities were the architect of their misfortune because they rejected the deployment of Special Task Force personnel to their communities.

According to him, the activities in the area were caused by criminals, which the STF would have contained, but the communities felt that they could protect themselves.

He said, “You remember that it was in these same areas that some cows were stolen and some herdsmen went missing. But these communities have refused the deployment of our men to their areas. They think that they have the wherewithal to protect themselves.”

Iweha exonerated STF personnel from any involvement in the criminality in the area, adding that despite the communities refusing STF deployment, the personnel have been responding to emergencies in those areas.

Confusion enveloped Dogarawa in Sabon Gari Local Government Area, a few kilometres from Zaria City, on Tuesday after a female suicide bomber detonated an Improvised Explosive Device, killing no fewer than 40 people while scores sustained varying degrees of injuries.

The deaths as well as those critically injured were taken to the St. Luke Hospital, Wusasa and the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Shika, both in Zaria.

Eyewitness said a verification of staff was in progress at the secretariat when the explosion occurred.

According to the source, the female suicide bomber joined the queue of staff, pretending to be part of the workers before detonating the explosive, killing over 30 people, including herself, instantly.

The exercise, it was gathered, coincided with the inaugural address by the new Chairman, Interim Management Committee of the local government.

Our correspondent also learnt that most of the victims were female primary school teachers from Kubau, Lere, Sabon Gari local governments among others.

The State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and the State Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Umar Shehu, visited the scene of the blast for an on-the-spot assessment of the incident.

El-Rufai confirmed the incident on his twitter handle, indicating that 20 people were killed in the blast that rocked the secretariat while staff verification was in progress.

Health workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that no fewer than 26 people died.

They said those critically injured were receiving treatment, noting that they needed blood, calling on people to donate blood to the victims.

Bello Hassan, 32, a worker at the secretariat, said the explosion happened while the verification exercise was going on.

“Frankly speaking, there is tension around the area. I can not give the figure (death) now but I saw many bodies that littered the ground,” he added.

Also, a female employee at the local government, Aisha Mohammed, told our correspondent on the telephone that they were in a 500 capacity hall when “suddenly, we heard a deafening sound of the explosion.”"

Three persons have been killed and some villagers wounded, as two deadly rival cult groups, Dewell and Axelander, clashed in Ubima community in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State.

Daily Sun gathered that some natives had relocated to neighbouring communities for safety, as the two cult groups resumed a battle for supremacy.

A source said trouble started yesterday morning when one of the leaders of Dewell, Chinedu Uwazurike (aka Biggi), entered the territory of Axelander to buy Indian hemp and was murdered in the process.

The source said: “Biggi is one of our members; he just came back from another town and decided to get Indian hemp; he could not get it from a nearby shop. So, he went to a seller close to Axelander barracks that was how they dragged him down from motorbike and started beating him until he collapsed and died.

“But, we have revenged by killing two of their members. The fight will continue because it is a disgrace on our side.”

Similarly, an Axelander member said Dewell had committed a lot of atrocities in the community.

According to the source, their members had been waiting for a time to react.

Reacting to the incident, Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area, Bestman Amadi, said he had visited the community, assuring them that the council would do everything possible to bring normalcy to the area with the cooperation of security agencies.

The police command in the state was yet to comment on the incident as at the time of filing this report."

""Five employees of a Nigerien company had their throats slit yesterday (Thursday) evening in Dagaya, a village near Bosso,"" Mayor of Bosso Bako Mamadou told AFP.

The victims were a driver, a carpenter and three construction workers who were working at a site in Dagaya, according to local radio.

""We do not know the circumstances of the attack,"" Mamadou said, adding that security measures had been put in place.

Local officials say they believe that the militants targeted the five workers, who were from the city of Diffa, which is located in the heartland of the Boko Haram insurgency.

Many young people from Diffa, which borders Nigeria, have joined the ranks of Boko Haram, getting paid about 300,000 CFA francs (around 450 euros or $500) per month, according to local officials. In June 38 civilians were killed -- including 14 women and 10 children -- in a Boko Haram attack targeting two villages in southeast Niger, close to Diffa.

Troops from Niger, Chad, Nigeria and Cameroon have been fighting Boko Haram insurgents for several months and have claimed a string of successes.

But a recent surge in an attacks has left analysts suggesting a decline in the intensity of operations has allowed the rebels to regroup and rearm.

The six-year insurgency, centered around northeast Nigeria, has claimed at least 15,000 lives."

TENSION and confusion reigned in Nkerefi community in Nkanu East local government area of Enugu State on Friday July 11, 2015, as suspected assassins invaded the area in the night, killing the traditional ruler of Isienu Amofu, Igwe Peter Onuoha.

Igwe Onuoha, the Eze Na Chi 1, until his assassination on Friday night, was the Managing Director of Posdonal Nigeria Limited and Secretary of Nkanu East Traditional Rulers Council.

Also, another man, simply identified as Chocho, ?and another man and his wife, whose identities were yet to be ascertained, were reportedly killed by the gunmen.

Several other members of the community, who were reportedly shot during the attack, which was under the cover of? darkness, were said to be receiving treatment at the Catholic Church-owned, Annunciation Specialists Hospital, Emene, Enugu.

According to sources, the community was thrown into confusion on Friday night when the people heard sporadic shooting rented the air.

Those residing near the palace of the royal father were said to have fled their homes on hearing the gunshots, but some of them were hit by the bullets.

At the end of the shooting, the residents discovered that their traditional ruler, Igwe Onuoha, and one Chocho had been shot dead.

The Personal Assistant to the royal father, identified as Vincent, was reportedly shot while fleeing the palace, but he survived the attack.

Within the neighbourhood, it was further? gathered that a man and his wife, a nurse, were also died from the gun shot injuries they had received.

The reason for the attack could not be immediately ascertained, but sources said the royal father and some youths in the community had disagreed over a suspicious rituals he reportedly made in the community sometime last year.

The source said: “Last year, Igwe and youths in the village had problem when they (youths) accused the monarch of retarding the progress of the community through fetish practices but the Igwe had reportedly told them that the sacrifice he did was purely for his protection and that of his family members and not on behalf of the entire community.

“Angered by the development, the youths were said to have forcefully uprooted the royal father’s signboard to express their disloyalty but the community leaders condemned the act and threatened to fish out and discipline the youths involved.

Some of the culprits ran out of the community since then but it is not clear for now if the exiled youths are responsible for this bloodbath.”

The Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, Ebere Amaraizu, who confirmed the incident, said the royal father and three others were killed in a bloody attack that occurred at Nkerefi on Friday night.

He said that the corpse of the royal father had been deposited at the Eastern Nigeria Medical Centre, Enugu, while three other corpses were deposited at Agbani Health Centre in Nkanu West local government area.

The police spokesman said that operatives of the state police command “are already on the matter to unravel the circumstances surrounding their deaths but from available information there seems to be an internal wrangling among the people of the community.”"

But for the alertness of a private security guard, hundreds of people would have been killed in the Sunday morning multiple blasts that rocked the Evangelical Church Winning All in Angwan Yanshi of Tudun Wada area of Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State.

The incident came as multiple acts of terror were also recorded around Maiduguri Saturday night.

A bomber detonated his explosives in a bus at a Maiduguri motor park, killing four people including himself. Other blasts targeted the Maiduguri office of the Department of State Security Service. The insurgents were also said to have mounted roadblocks around Damagum and set many vehicles ablaze.

But in the Jos church blast, an eye witness told our correspondent that the church was full to the brim with worshippers who came for the first morning service when one of the bombs went off.

The eyewitness, who gave his name as Garuba, said that after controlling the panicky worshippers, the guard was said to have started combing the premises when he discovered another bomb near the toilet.

The brave guard did not wait to alert anybody as he quickly picked the lethal parcel and threw it over the fence. The parcel exploded spontaneously, missing him just by a whisker. He however sustained minor injuries from the flying shrapnel.

Men of the anti-bomb squad were later called in. When they were combing the area, another improvised electronic devise (IED) was discovered in an abandoned kiosk, some 10 metres away.

Officer in charge of Anti-bomb in the Plateau State Police Command, Mr. Abel Mbibi, told our correspondent on Sunday that his men were able to detonate the bomb safely, with no threat to lives and property.

According to him, the IED is an anti-tilted device.

“We discovered that the IED is an anti-tilted device. This means that it was constructed in such a way that it will explode any time it is turned either way by person or object. That was why it exploded immediately the guard picked it up. Our men also combed the area and we discovered the same type of bomb in an abandoned kiosk about 10 metres away,” Mbibi said.

The latest incident came less than a week after suicide bombers attacked the Dilimi mosque in the same Jos North Local Government Area. The ECWA Church in Tudun Wada is located near the Federal Secretariat, very close to the Jos home of Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha. One of the guards in the house told our correspondent that the explosion shook the foundation of the building and others around it.

Speaking on the blasts, the police said no one was killed from the blasts. The Police Public Relations Manager, DSP Emmanuel Abuh, said that the area was thoroughly combed after the blast and there was no further threat.

Meanwhile, a non-governmental organisation, Salvation Army, has donated 250 bags of rice and other relief materials to the Internally Displaced Persons’ camp at Bondon village, Kaura Local Government Area in Southern Kaduna, Kaduna State.

The Coordinator, Mrs. Comfort Adepoju, while presenting the relief material to victims of attacks by gunmen at Bondon village, Kaura LGA, also sought for the establishment of a health centre in the area.

She argued that setting up a health centre by the state government would drastically curb mortality rate in the area.

The organisation distributed items such as 240 bags (of 25kg) of rice; some other 10kg bags for each family; packets of magi and salt; vegetable oil (three litres) for each family; cardigans for children as well as 1,750 blankets to help cushion the cold weather.

According to her, the need for the establishment of a health centre in the area was necessary considering the magnitude of lives lost due to lack of emergency care for victims of the attacks.

She said the need for an establishment of a health centre in the area was necessary considering the magnitude of lives lost due to lack of emergency care for victims of the attacks.

She noted that most of the casualties of the attacks were those who died before being rushed to hospitals in Jos, Plateau State.

She said, “It is reported that a lot of injured persons died as a result of lack of prompt medical care while women have had miscarriages and died during such attacks.

“If only there was at least one health centre in the area, the situation may have been contained.

“We are told that the nearest hospitals are those in Kafanchan and Jos and these are grossly inadequate.”

She said the NGO had identified 240 families in the area who needed succour that would enable them a meaningful livelihood. She added that the families identified had lost their bread winners to the attacks.

“It is sad to hear that most of these women and children still sleep on bare floor and are exposed to hazards of the weather,” she said.

One of the beneficiaries, Musa Emmanuel, noted that it had been difficult surviving at the camp since the attacks as a result of inadequate foodstuff, beddings and other related items.

Another beneficiary, Victor Didam, said they slept on the bare floor in congested classrooms, adding that it was difficult to come by portable drinking water.

Our gateman was querying the occupants of the other car but they hit him and ordered him to lie down.

“The men in the black car came out before daddy could alight from his car and one of them shot into the air. Two of them advanced to dadd’s car while others came inside. Grandma started begging those that came inside to spare our lives . Suddenly, we heard gunshot twice from the outside.

“The assailants left at 10:20 and took daddy’s car away. I overheard daddy begging them that they should not take him away. When they left, we thought they took him away and we started praying for the safety of daddy without knowing that he had been killed.

A couple was yester­day murdered in cold blood in Kat­sina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State barely 24 hours after Atoza Ihindan, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and 19 others were assassinated in vari­ous parts of the local gov­ernment area. The assassinated victims, Mr and Mrs. Tyav Yina, were in their bedroom about 7am, yesterday, when the gunmen stormed their house, and headed straight for their room and shot both of them dead.

The daredevil gunmen were said to have thereafter shot sporadically into the air before escaping on a motor­bike as residents scampered for safety.

Recall that Katsina-Ala Local Government Area had been a field of blood in the aftermath of the general elec­tions, a development that had made many prominent sons of the area to flee for their lives.

Reacting to the develop­ment, social critic, Alhaji Abubakar Tsav, described the wanton killings in the area as unacceptable and warned that if nothing was done quickly to stop it, the situation might degenerate to the kind of in­surgency the country is cur­rently battling with in the North East.

“What you see happening in Katsina/Ala is becom­ing uncontrollable because hardly a day passes without reports of gruesome murders of persons; this is how Boko Haram started in the North East.” Confirming the report, the state Police Public Rela­tions Officer, (PPRO), ASP Austin Ezeani, disclosed that the Commissioner of Police, Hyacinth Dagala, had already directed the Assistant Com­missioner of Police in-charge of Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Unit to move into the area.

“As I speak with you, a suspect with fresh bullet wounds has been arrested; he also took our men to the home of another suspect, where a large cache of arms was recovered, but though the owner of the house is on the run, we are on his trail,” Ezeani said."

Nasarawa State Governor, Tanko Al-Makura

No fewer than 10 persons were killed on Saturday when violence erupted in the Tudun Adabu area of Obi Local Government of Nasarawa State.

The violence erupted as a result of the tussle between two Eggon factions jostling to produce the head of the locality.

It was gathered that over 15 houses were razed down during the fracas between the two factions.

The incident occurred at about 11am on Saturday morning when the new head of Mai-Angwan Tudun Adabu, Alhaji Muhammed Isyaka, led his followers to make a courtesy call on Osuko Obi, Alhaji Ogiri Orume, in celebration of the Sallah festival.

It was gathered that the other faction, which was unhappy about the installation of Isyaka by the village head of Odobu, Mr. Odobu Okira, barricaded the road leading to Osuko of Obi’s residence and started shooting sporadically.

It was learnt that 10 persons died in the fracas while several others were injured.

The aggrieved Eggon faction, said to be in the majority, alleged that due process was not followed in the installation of Isyaka.

Women and children in the area had fled their homes for fear of being attacked by the warring parties.

Speaking to our correspondent in an interview in Lafia, one of the residents in Obi Local Government, Mr. Yusuf Mabu, said, “The genuine head of Tudun Adabu, Alhaji Isyaka, who was given the mantle of leadership to pilot the affairs of his people led a delegation to Osuko of Obi’s palace when the other group barricaded the road and attacked them.”

Giving another version of the story, Mabu said crisis erupted when some Eggon youths sympathetic with the cause of the other faction attempted to present their candidate for installation.

A member of the aggrieved faction, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was wrong for Okira to have installed Isyaka, who was a son to a former Mai-Angwan. He insisted that the position was not hereditary.

The aggrieved member said the selection of Mai-Angwan should follow democratic process wherein all Eggon tribes in obi Local Government should be allowed to participate.

But the Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, Nasarawa State command, Mancha Christ, who confirmed the incident in a telephone interview in Lafia, said there was no casualty in the incident.

According to him, the command had since deployed its men to the area in order to prevent a further escalation of violence.

Suspected militants of Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram on Monday attacked a gendarmerie camp in Cameroon’s Far-North Region.

An unnamed army source told Xinhua that fighters from Nigeria crossed the border and raided the camp in Afade, a border village, in early morning, burning down two vehicles and killing two “detainees.”

The fighters ran away before the defence and security forces could take any action, the source said.

Four soldiers and three policemen were found missing after the attack. It is still unknown whether they were kidnapped by the fighters, according to the source.

A suspected Boko Haram member on Saturday carried out a suicide bomb attack in Maroua, capital of Far-North, leaving at least 25 people killed, according to hospital sources.

Boko Haram started attack on northern Cameroon in 2013. Chad sent troops in Cameroon in January to help in the defence against the group.

Students of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, Abeokuta, now live in fear as two suspected cult groups have gone on the rampage in the last one week, which has led to the death of four persons.

The killings took place at different points in the Oluwo and Adigbe, which is largely populated by the students in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State.

The four people killed were said to be students of the institution, forcing other students to flee their hostels following the mop up of suspected cultists in the areas by the police.

Our correspondent gathered that the killings were a fallout of a supremacy battle, which broke out two weeks ago among suspected members of Eiye and Buccaneer confraternities in the areas.

It was learnt that one Muraina Ibrahim, popularly called Elebe of ND II, Computer Engineering Department, was killed last Wednesday along the popular sap route while another ND II student of Mass Communication Department, simply identified as Demola, was killed last Saturday around MacJob in the Fowobi area of Abeokuta.

Identities of the two other desceased had yet to be ascertained as of the time of filing this report but one of them was reportedly killed at the Mango area of Oluwo also on Saturday while the other was killed at Iyana Oloke.

Meanwhile, the institution Public Relations Officer, Mr. Sulaiman Adebiyi, said he heard that two people were killed, “but it has not been ascertained if they were students of MAPOLY.”

He said eight students of the institution had been arrested by the police over the killings, but described many of the arrests as arbitrary.

Our correspondent learnt that the hostel where one of the victims, Demola, resided during the last semester, Power House, had been under lock and key for days.

One of the students leaders, who spoke with our correspondent, Ifeoluwa Adegbola, also described the arrests as ‘indiscriminate.’

Adegbola said, “The Police started raiding on Saturday; some were arrested at Q bar in Adigbe while others were arrested along the streets and bus stops.”

The Police Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said nine students had been arrested in connection with the killings.

He explained that the police had been battling security challenges in Onikolobo and some other areas of the state, warning the students not to abuse their status and attack police officers."

Suspected armed robbers have attacked female students of Ebonyi State University (EBSU), Abakalki in their hostel close to the College of Agricultural Sciences (CAS), injuring three students and two security men.

Daily Sun gathered that the hoodlums forced their way into ‘Oduoye Hostel’, a female hostel, situated outside the campus at about 1am.

It was learnt that two security men at the gate of the school were injured by the robbers; a situation which made others to run into hiding for safety.

According to eyewitness, “We were already asleep when we began to hear strange movement and noise, only to discover that robbers have invaded our hostel. They were entering rooms one after the other attacking and dispossessing people of their belongings, including phones and laptops.”

Dean, Students Affairs of EBSU, Prof. Hillary Eze, confirmed the incident, but noted that the robbery operation was quelled through prompt intervention of security agents.

“There was a robbery incident at one of our hostels. The robbers forced themselves into some rooms, which means the burglarproofs were forcefully removed, doors broken and students were attacked. I think by our calculation, about 16 phones and two or three laptops were made away with by the robbers, while security men on duty were also manhandled.”

He described as untrue that robbers shot some security men, saying the robbers only attacked the students and the security men with cutlasses just as he denied that four students were abducted

Prof. Eze, who said the three female students and two security men were injured, added that they were immediately rushed to the state police clinic by the policemen deployed to the scene and had been treated and discharged immediately.

The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Chris Anyanwu, when contacted, said he could not confirm the robbery attack because he was away on official duty at Abuja."

The peace of the university town of Nsukka was shattered on Monday as a middle-aged secondary school teacher was shot dead by unknown gunmen.

Mrs. Amaka Ugwu, a classroom teacher at Urban Boys Secondary School, Nsukka, was allegedly murdered at about 7p.m near Ikenga Hotels junction, Nsukka.

Daily Sun source said that “the late Mrs. Ugwu was coming back from where she went to see some family friends when the gunmen numbering about three, who had been trailing her,

double-crossed her at the junction. Thinking that the hoodlums were trapped by the potholes at the junction, the deceased slowed down, sounded her horn and flashed her head for them to shift a little out of the road.

“By that time, the deceased was already shouting at them for blocking her way. One of the gunmen disembarked from their bike, came to her side and pointed the gun at her. At that time, one of her husband’s relations who was with her in the car ran out and made straight to their house, which is about 100 metres away, to report to the husband about what was going on. The husband on hearing that his wife was being threatened by unknown persons, ran out, wielding machete and shouting on top of his voice that he was going to deal with anybody who hurt his wife.”

Our source added that when the husband got to where his wife’s car was parked, he discovered that she had been shot in the head before her attackers zoomed off on a motorbike. He then rushed the deceased to the hospital where she was pronounced dead.

“When we checked her car, her handsets, money and other valuables inside the car were still intact. None of them were touched. They were just sent to kill her and nothing more. We even heard from those near the scene during the incident that she was begging them to take her phone and other valuables but spare her life but they refused. Rather, they shot her on the head and her brain scattered on the windscreen of her car when we went there,” one of her relations who pleaded anonymity explained.

Daily Sun investigation revealed that for over six months now, the gunmen had been trailing the deceased, a situation that made her always go out with one of her relations.

When our reporter visited the Divisional Police Officer, Nsukka urban Headquarters, Mr. James Nwokolo for confirmation, he was said to have gone to Enugu on official duty. But a senior police officer, who pleaded anonymity confirmed the incident.

Our reporter learned the body of the deceased has been deposited at Bishop Shanahan Hospital, Nsukka.

Two policemen have been killed by some suspected gunmen in Bayelsa State.

It was learnt that the gunmen stormed the residence of the Chairman of Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, Remember Ogbe, to abduct him, but were engaged in a gun battle by the policemen attached to the council boss.

A source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “The gunmen continued shooting especially after they were initially repelled by the police. They kept shooting at the chairman’s building.

“But the policemen withstood them. They showed some gallantry. However, two of the policemen were not lucky. They were hit by bullets and died.

“The gunmen escaped without fulfilling their mission, which was to abduct the chairman.”

The source, however, said the gunmen escaped into the creeks with the riffles of the slain policemen.

The incident, it was gathered, threw the community into confusion and sent residents scampering for safety.

A police squad carried out preliminary investigations on the incident and later arrested a suspected mastermind of the incident identified as Seigha Oduwaiye, 24.

Oduwaiye, who hails from Akassa in Brass Local Government Area, was said to have made useful statements to the police.

Spokesman for the Bayelsa State Police Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, said detectives had intensified efforts to arrest Oduwaiye’s accomplices.

He said, “On July 30, 2015, at about 8pm, four daredevil gunmen stormed the residence of the Chairman of Southern Ijaw LGA, Remember Ogbe, at Amassoma to abduct him, but were engaged in a gun battle by the policemen attached to the Chairman.

“The gunmen retreated, but the two police corporals lost their lives due to injuries sustained in the encounter.

“The bodies of the slain policemen have been deposited at the morgue of the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa.”

Also in the state, a gang of kidnappers was said to have attacked the residence of one Mrs. Tonye Aroh in Opume community and abducted her.

The 80-year-old Aroh was kidnapped at about 8pm, same time the other gang of gunmen killed the policemen.

The victim was whisked away in a speedboat.

Confirming the incident, Chairman of the Ijaw Youth Council, Ogbia Clan, Mr. Osanya B. Osanya, condemned the abduction and urged the kidnappers to release the old woman without delay.

FROM TIMOTHY OLAN­REWAJU, MAIDUGURI, WITH AGENCY REPORT

No fewer than 117 Boko Haram fighters have been killed in an opera­tion against insurgents holed up on the islands of Lake Chad, the Chadian army said in a statement Friday.

The insurgents suffered the loss on a day a female sui­cide bomber suspected to be a member of the sect killed at least eight people in a market in Maiduguri, Borno state.

“117 terrorists have been killed, two Chadian soldiers died and two others were wounded” in the operation against the Nigeria-based movement, which began two weeks ago, Chadian army spokesman Colonel Azem Ber­mendoa Agouna said.

“For two weeks, Boko Ha­ram terrorists have been trying to infiltrate our islands on Lake Chad to carry out attacks on peaceful citizens,” Azem said, adding that military operations were ongoing.

Lake Chad is a strategic re­gion where the borders of Chad and northeast Nigeria converge with those of Cameroon and Niger, further north.

Boko Haram has carried out raids and suicide bombings in all four countries, which have formed a military alliance along with Benin republic to tackle the movement.

“Our armed forces and secu­rity forces have launched a vast offensive to dig out and neu­tralise these terrorists on these islands,” Azem said.

No immediate confirmation of the death toll could be gotten from independent sources.

“Several boats have been destroyed and several weapons of different calibres have been recovered,” added the colonel, who specified that the operation had notably targeted the island villages of Koungya, Merik­outa, Choua and Blarigui.

“The sweep continues and the definitive toll will be re­leased later,” the spokesman said.

About 1,000 Chadian sol­diers have been deployed in the area of Lake Chad “to occupy all the islands and neutralise Boko Haram”, a security source said. Chad’s government urged local villagers to leave before the offensive started.

Boko Haram forces, who have killed some 15,000 people since their insurgency began in 2009, use the Lake Chad is­lands to fall back after coming under heavy attack in Nigeria by the regional coalition, in which the Chadian army has taken a leading role since the joint operation was formed early this year.

Meanwhile, a female suicide bomber on a tricycle killed about eight people Friday in a new attack on a market in Mai­duguri, witnesses said, as Nige­ria and its neighbours finalise a force to fight Boko Haram.

“We took seven dead bod­ies, including that of the female bomber, to the hospital. Eight other people were injured and are now receiving treatment in a hospital,” Babakura Kolo, a vigilante in the northeastern town, told AFP.

The blast was the latest in a wave of attacks on busy mar­kets — many by teenage girls — in Nigeria, Chad and Camer­oon, which claimed at least 130 lives and left scores injured this month.

“The attack (on the Gam­boru) market happened around 6:30 am (0530 GMT) as the grocers were arriving in the market which starts early,” ac­cording to Kolo, who became a vigilante to help the Nigerian army combat Boko Haram.

“From accounts we gathered from people around, the wom­an arrived on a taxi tricycle, as every woman grocer does. She blew herself up as soon as the tricycle stopped in the midst of other tricycles dropping traders off,” Kolo said.

“I was at home when I heard a loud explosion that sent me rushing out of my house. It was coming from the Gamboru mar­ket… The place was littered with victims and burning rickshaws,” a local resident told AFP.

Gamboru market is the sec­ond largest in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state and birth­place of Boko Haram, which has killed at least 15,000 people since its bloody insurgency be­gan in 2009.

The extremist sect, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is forbid­den”, has carried on its cam­paign of attacks on security forces, suicide bombings and bloody raids on villages across Nigeria’s north and eastern bor­ders despite a major regional military campaign against them."

Alonge assured that the Air Force would continue to provide combat air support to the ground force in all op­erations carried out by Ni­gerian troops against Boko Haram in the North-east.

“The Nigerian Air Force, using its alpha jet, provided combat air support to the ground force to attack the insurgents, where they were observed to be mopping up to carry out a deadly attack on the village.

Leader of a faction of the Odua People’s Congress, Gani Adams

No fewer than three people were feared dead on Sunday at Agbamu in Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, following a clash among members of the Oodua Peoples’ Congress.

An eyewitness, who pleaded anonymity, said no fewer than six people, sustained varying degrees of injuries during the fracas. He added that the injured victims were rushed to some undisclosed private hospitals in the council, where they were receiving medical treatment.

The source said that the trouble erupted when some OPC members, who were allegedly expelled recently from the group, stormed St. Paul Anglican Primary School, Agbamu, where the 10th anniversary of the coronation of Arigbamu of Agbamu, Oba Samuel Dare, was being held, to protest their expulsion before the OPC National Coordinator, Mr. Gani Adams.

The protest was said not to have gone down well with some members of the state chapter of the OPC, which later snowballed into a violent clash among the OPC members.

A policeman at Agbamu Police Post, who pleaded anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to journalists on the issue, confirmed to journalists that three people died.

He added that many victims sustained injuries during the clash.

He said, “We never envisaged this kind of security breach; hence, we would have called for reinforcement from other neighbouring police stations. By virtues of their large numbers, they held everybody into ransom.

“I can confirm to you that three people were shot dead while several others were seriously injured. The injured ones have been taken to nearby private hospitals.”

The Police Public Relations Officer, Kwara State Command, Mr. Ajayi Okasanmi, said he was yet to be briefed of the clash.

A Lebanese staff of a construction company in Niger State, Enerco Nigeria Ltd., has been kidnapped by suspected gunmen in the Ekila community along Tegina-Minna road in the north western state.

The victim, who was simply identified as Rody, was said to have been kidnapped by heavily armed gunmen at about 5 pm Sunday while traveling to a construction site at Tegina in the official vehicle of the company alongside some staff of the state’s Ministry of Works and Infrastructural Development.

Daily Sun gathered that among the occupants of the vehicle with the victim as at the time of the incident was the driver of the company’s Hilux van, Isaiah Ekwere, while others included Hamidu Usman and Salihu Mustapha of the Ministry.

Trouble began for the Lebanese after the vehicle was said to have been overtaken by another vehicle with some heavily armed people who were shooting into the air.

A reliable police source who asked to remain anonymous in a brief chat yesterday in Minna stated that the Lebanese national allegedly ordered the driver of the construction company, Isaiah Ekwere, to reverse in order to head into a bush by the side of the road.

“The driver complied with the instruction and all of them came out of the Hilux Van and ran inside the bush. The driver and other Nigerians entered the bush on one side while the Lebanese construction worker ran into the bush in a different direction for a reason yet to be ascertained by the police,” said the police source.

The source further disclosed that no sooner had the incident occurred that a distressed call was made to the police patrol team by some concerned citizens.

“When the police patrol team got to the scene the three people who had earlier ran inside the bush saw the police and started coming out of the bush, so everyone was found except the Lebanese national who took a different direction in the bush,” the source stated.

When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Niger State Police Command, ASP Bala Elkana confirmed the incident, saying “we have deployed a search patrol team who are now looking for the Lebanese national who has been declared missing by his employers while the case is still under investigation.”

The attack came barely 24 hours after Orient Pe­troleum Board of Direc­tors visited Governor Wil­lie Obiano of Anambra State and informed that the company had acquired two new wells in Agul­eri and would increase its crude oil production to 3,000 barrels per day next month.

The attackers, allegedly took the farmers unawares and as many of them ran into the river. They invad­ers attacked six of them, killing two and wounding four, who are being treat­ed at a private hospital in Onitsha.

No fewer than 15 persons on Friday evening reportedly sustained various degree of injuries during a clash between men of the Nigerian Army and police officers from the Oba Market Police Station in Benin, the Edo State capital.

A pregnant woman was also said to be among the injured in the clash, which forced some residents and shops owners to scamper for safety as the security operatives fired several shots and tear gas during the conflict.

Many residents were said to have been injured in the stampede that followed the incident.

The trouble reportedly started when 10 policemen allegedly beat up two soldiers to stupor at Ibiwe junction at the city centre.

Some eyewitnesses said that the action of the policemen followed the alleged assault of a female traffic warden for allegedly preventing the soldiers from driving through a heavy traffic.

One of the soldiers was said to have repeatedly slapped the woman until some policemen intervened, resulting in a free-for-all.

A soldier was said to have been detained as a result of the incident, a situation which reportedly led some soldiers, in over 7 patrol vans, to invade the police station, forcing the policemen in the station to lock themselves inside the station while business owners locked their shops to prevent looting.

The soldiers were said to have laid a two hour siege at the police station, which lasted till around 6:20pm, following the intervention of senior police officers in the state.

When contacted, the spokesman for the Nigerian Army, 4 Brigade, Captain Jonah Unuakhalu, told our correspondent that the command was not involved in the clash, adding that the issue had been resolved with the divisional police officer of the station.

Nigerian soldiers and members of the Boko Haram sect are currently engaged in a gunbattle in Gadaka, a town in Yobe state, TheCable has reported.

According to a source, the insurgents launched an onslaught on the town over the night, in a bid to seize it, while soldiers responded this morning to put up a resistance.

The source said, “As I speak to you now, there are three fighter jets bombarding the militants. They came to the town last night and the military responded this morning. They wanted to take over the town, because they were even telling people to leave and threatening to kill those who would not obey.

“More Boko Haram members wanted to gain access to Gadaka this morning but they were unable to enter the town because it rained heavily last night and the whole road has been taken over by flood.”

Efforts to confirm the development from the Yobe State police command did not yield any result, as Mr. Marcus Danladi, who was until last Friday the state police commissioner, said he had no information.

Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City

Tragedy struck at Ibillo, Akoko Edo Local Government Area of Edo State when a man popularly known as Alhaji, murdered three persons including a three-year-old boy, after a quarrel over the ownership of a bitter leaf plant in the compound.

The sad incident, THISDAY gathered occurred at Ogo quarters Ibillo Sunday evening.

The three killed included a man identified as Mr. Aliu Ademo, a girl called Favour and a little boy, Isaac, who later died yesterday morning at the hospital.

Trouble started when the Alhaji had a heated quarrel with the daughter of a co-tenant called Favour over the bitter

leaf plant in the compound.

According to a source, Alhaji went to harvest the vegetable without the consent of the owner which angered the daughter of the woman, Favour.

The source said: “Alhaji who is from Igbira, came out with a cutlass and beheaded the girl. Mr Aliu saw what happened and started shouting, Alhaji ran after Isaac, the little boy to kill him but Aliu stopped him in order to save the boy.

“The effort however failed as the aggressor succeeded in matcheting both the small boy and Aliu.

“He decided to kill the man because the man came to save the little boy. The small boy was rushed to the hospital because he was still unconscious but we later heard he died this morning (Monday). Alhaji is on the run now but the police is looking for him,” an eyewitness disclosed.

The Police Public Relations Officer in Edo State, Mr. Stephen Onwechei, confirmed the incident, saying “the suspect is currently on the run but we are on his trail. He will be arrested. He abandoned his cutlass and took off after the killing.

“When people came around to stop him, he matcheted them including the three-year-old child.

“That is barbaric. I understand he previously had quarrel with the mother of the child over the ownership of the bitter leaf in the compound. That is madness but we must arrest him no matter how far he tries to run. He must face justice for his wicked act,” he declared."

For the second time in two months, the Plateau State Government has declared a curfew on Barki Ladi and Riyom Local Government Areas, after no fewer than 15 people have been killed in clandestine attacks in the last seven days.

The native Berom people and the Hausa/Fulani herdsmen have engaged themselves in in violent clashes in the two areas.

The first curfew was imposed on June 24, barely one month into the life of the present administration.

President of Berom Youths Movement, Mr. Choji Chuwang, told our correspondent on Thursday that Berom had been turned into a killing field by armed herdsmen, who daily waylaid and killed people in their farms and along the road.

He said in all these incidents, there appeared not to have been any proactive measures by security agencies and government officials to curtail the spate of killings.

Chuwang alleged that the attacks were acts of terrorism against the Berom.

He added, “After the state government set up a peace committee that met with both sides and asked us to sheathe our swords, killings have been going on on a daily basis; burial ceremonies are being conducted on a daily basis in Berom land.

“Our people are being waylaid and killed on their way to their farms and along the road and there is silence from everybody. We are being tagged the aggressors, whereas, what is happening is not acts of aggression but terrorism.”

He said on Thursday, four people were killed in Gashish district of Barkin Ladi and more than 15 houses destroyed in Kwi, Riyom in the last two days.

Chuwang alleged that some of security agents were culpable, as they often looked the other way while vulnerable people, especially old men, women and children, were being killed.

He appealed to the authorities to put a stop to the killings and wanton destruction of property and farmlands.

Announcing the curfew, Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Rufus Bature, said the action had become necessary because the attacks had continued unabated.

A statement by Bature, on Thursday, said, “The curfew starts at 6pm and ends at 6am.”"

Hunters and members of a vigilance group on Sunday killed 100 members of Boko Haram and arrested 17 other suspected members of the the sect in the Madagali area of Adamawa State.

It was learnt that the killings followed the raiding of Madagali, Michika and Mubi by hunters during which over 280 women and children were rescued.

Investigation by The PUNCH indicated that three local hunters were injured following the exchange of gunshots with the insurgents. They were being treated at Madagali General Hospital.

The PUNCH reported that 200 youths were recruited and were given a special training to face the dreaded group in the last two weeks by the member representing Madagali state House of Assembly, Emmanuel Tsamdu.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Adamawa State Command, ASP Othman Abubakar, who said he was aware of the killings, said that he was still waiting for the official confirmation from the Divisional Police Officer in the area.

But efforts to reach the DPO in Madagali to confirm the information proved abortive as several calls to his mobile phone were not successful.

Meanwhile, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device wrapped around her body near a market in a village in Borno State, killing at least three people, police and civilian vigilante sources said on Saturday.

No one claimed responsibility for the attack.

A member of the vigilance group said four people were killed and seven people injured when the explosive went off at a checkpoint, targeting the vigilantes at the entrance of the Ramirgo Market.

Ishiaku Dawa, a resident who helped in taking the victims to the hospital, said the blast damaged two patrol vehicles.

“Three persons, including the suicide bomber, died on the spot. The Corpses and the injured victims were carried to the General Hospital,” Borno State Police commissioner, Aderemi Opadokun, who visited the scene, told Reuters in a text message.

Opadokun said the attack occurred on Saturday morning in Ramirgo village, adding that the victims were taken to the General Hospital in Askira, Uba town, Borno State– about 250 kilometres (160 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State and the epicentre of the insurgency.

Military spokesman, Sani Kukasheka Usman, confirmed the blast in a statement, saying the suicide bomber was on the way to attack the market.

Usman said the bomber was accosted by a civilian vigilante, but the bomb went off during interrogation, killing the suspect. He said the vigilante was injured and rushed to the hospital.

Two soldiers on advance to Dikwa, Borno state, were yesterday killed and two wounded by landmines planted along the route by the Boko Haram terrorists, even as troops advancing to Boko Haram enclaves, also killed a large number of insurgents.

These latest casualties join a list of 1,059 Nigerians killed by the insurgents since May 29 this year according to Stefanos, a humanitarian foundation.

An operational update by the Army Headquarters, AHQ, through its Director of Army Public Relations, DAPR, Colonel Sani Usman, said the incident occured. As troops of 5 Brigade Explosive Ordinance Devices (EOD) unit, advancing towards Dikwa, ran into landmines buried by the terrorists between old Marte and Kerenoa junction in Guzamala Local Government Area of Borno State.

“Unfortunately, 2 soldiers lost their lives, while 2 others were critically injured due to the landmine explosion”, Usman said. The DAPR disclosed that the bodies of the two gallant soldiers have been evacuated, to the rear, while the other two wounded soldiers have also been evacuated and are receiving treatment at the military hospital.

He said that the formation also lost a Mowag Armoured Personnel Carrier, APC, at the same location. “Despite this sad event, the troops are not deterred as they continued their advance and pursuing the terrorists to their enclaves in Sambisa forest.

“Similarly, it is important to note that troops in the various formations and units in Operation LAFIYA DOLE are in very high spirit and more determined to destroy the terrorists camps and enclaves”, he added.

Equally, he said that troops of 7 Brigade yesterday, entered and cleared Gudumbali town, Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State. ”During the operation, quite a number of the terrorists were killed their weapons and equipment were destroyed. The troops are currently doing clearance operations in the general area”, the Army Spokesman stated.

The Nigerian Air Force had earlier at the beginning of the week, inflicted heavy damage on the terrorists camps within the general area.

In a related development, executive director, Stefanos Foundation, Mr. Mark Lipdo, has said no fewer than 1,059 persons were killed in 75 major attacks in northern Nigeria since the inception of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.

A research organised by one Stefanos Foundation has revealed Boko Haram has orchestrated 75 major attacks in the North-Eastern part of Nigeria since President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office during which 1,059 lives have been claimed. This was revealed by the Executive Director of the group, Mr. Mark Lipdo.

Stefanos Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, has been attending to the welfare of Internally Displaced Persons from the various attacks in their camps in Bukuru area of Jos South, Plateau State.

Lipdo said the highest number of attacks occurred in Borno State, where 551 people were killed.

In a statement in Jos on Thursday, which was made available to journalsts, Lipdo said all the attacks occurred between May 29 and August 12, especially under the watch of the recently sacked service chiefs.

According to him, Plateau State ranked second with 19 attacks and 112 people killed while Yobe occupied the third spot with eight attacks and 86 people killed.

Adamawa, Bauchi, Benue, Gombe, Kano, Nasarawa and Taraba states placed fourth with two attacks each and a total of 254 people killed.

Member representing Barkin Ladi/Riyom Federal Constituency, Mr. Istifanus Gyang, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the lingering crises in Plateau State so as to bring the unending attacks on innocent citizens to an end.

Gyang’s plea came as two people were killed by some unknown men on Saturday evening. Their bodies were discovered on Sunday morning.

The victims, said to be cousins and whose names were given as Ibrahim Nyam and Jimmy Pam, were said to have been ambushed and killed by unknown gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen as they were heading to Jos from Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of the state.

A family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, “The unknown gunmen attacked the men and left them in the pool of their blood on Saturday evening. Both men were married and had children.”

Gyang described the ambush as “barbaric and a reign of terror” saying it was totally illegal and unlawful.

He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to give an immediate directive to the military’s high command, as he did in the case of the Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East, to end the killings.

Gyang, who spoke to our correspondent on Sunday, decried the daily loss of lives in his constituency and called the Federal Government to intervene and bring the crisis to an end.

He said that thousands of lives had been lost and thousands of acres of farm-land destroyed by rampaging herdsmen.

Bodies of the two armed robbers at the Mile One Police Division in Port Harcourt on Wednesday

TWO daredevil armed robbers were shot and killed by the police on Wednesday after they robbed The PUNCH office located at Mile One Diobu in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.

The armed robbers had entered the Circulation Office of the media organisation at about 1.30pm and asked the Circulation Manager, Mr. Raheem Olatunde, to surrender the money with him.

It was gathered that one of the hoodlums, who were initially three in number, had escaped during the incident.

While Olatunde refused to talk to them, one of the hoodlums had brandished a gun before him, while the other spotted a yellow bag where the sum of N500,000 meant for operations was kept.

Satisfied that they had taken the money, the bandits rushed down the stair case, but not without violently pushing the Advert Executive, Mrs. Nnena Ochuko, who had unknowingly queried their mission to The PUNCH office.

Narrating the incident to our correspondent, Olatunde explained that it was not up to three minutes he entered the office after his transaction at the bank that two hefty men entered his office with one of them pointing a gun at him.

“While the two of them were searching for the money, one of my friends working for The News noticed that all was not well in my office, decided to ask from a distance what was happening. I winked at him and gave him a sign, which he understood.

“He went down immediately and raised the alarm. A neighbour identified as Nana rushed to the main entrance of the building and locked the gate before the armed robber could get there.

“A crowd was already gathering close to the building housing The PUNCH Newspapers. When the armed robbers got to the gate that was locked by Nana, one of them kicked it with his leg and it flung open,” Olatunde said.

Realising that a mob had already gathered, The PUNCH Circulation man explained that one of the armed robbers released the first gunshot that temporarily made the mob to withdraw from the place.

A man, who operates a boutique in the same building also told newsmen that gathered at the place after the incident that the determined mob pursued the armed robbers, who appeared to have run shot of bullets.

The boutique operator, who is simply called Best, said the armed robbers were not familiar with the terrain and suspected that an insider must have been directing one of them through the telephone on how to get their target.

“We saw one of them making calls and from what he was saying, an insider must have been directing him (armed robber) on how to get to Olatunde’s office without wasting time.

“The crowd chased the armed robbers up to Abakaliki Street and when they ran out of bullets, they ran into a restaurant. The mob began to throw stones, bottles and other dangerous objects into the restaurant.

“The mob later dragged one of them out of the restaurant, gave him a beating of his life before the police came in. The armed robber that was holding the bag containing the money was later caught, after he tried to escape from where he was hiding before he was shot,” another eyewitness added.

At the Mile One Police Division, a huge crowd had gathered to view the bodies of the two armed robbers that were later thrown into a patrol vehicle before they were driven away.

Olatunde, who was still shocked as a result of the incident, said the police released the sum of N250,000 to him as the amount recovered from the armed robbers.

He, however, hailed Port Harcourt residents and passersby, who were able to form a mob that ensured that the two armed robbers did not escape.

Confirming the incident, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, hailed the police and members of the public for their speedy response in foiling the robbery attempt.

Mohammad, who was at the Mile One Police Division to see the bodies of the criminals, said, “Definitely, the Commissioner of Police has assured us of timely response. Our men went into action as part of the timely response and two of the suspected robbers were fatally wounded (died as a result of gunshot injuries) while the other two escaped.

“I know that these bad people are on the prowl, trailing innocent people to rob them. But the state police command is not relenting too. These bad elements can choose to repent or they keep on with their criminal acts. But one day, we will get them as we did today.

“I will advise members of the public to reduce physical banking transaction and go more for electronic transaction since the ATMs are there. Physical banking transaction should only be done when it is unavoidable,” Mohammad said."

No fewer than three persons were feared dead in Onitsha, Anambra State, on Sunday evening when a group, Independent People of Biafra, clashed with security operatives.

It was gathered that 20 persons were injured in the clash.

A member of the group, Chinwendu Ikechukwu, told newsmen that the group had after its meeting held at Nkpor, Idemili-North Local Government Area of the state, decided to go and preach to the people on the need to embrace the struggle for Biafran state when the trouble ensued.

He said, “On reaching Okpoko junction, we were accosted by a detachment of policemen who fired teargas canisters at our members numbering about 5,000.

“They later allowed us to go since we were non-violent but on reaching Uga Junction before the Niger Bridge, the naval men on duty there opened fire on us.

“In our defenceless state, three of our members were shot dead while about twenty others sustained injuries.

“Even the police who initially allowed us to go later joined in shooting our members.”

Ikechukwu said all the injured were initially rushed to Paragon Hospital, Fegge, before some of them were taken to other hospitals.

When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Anambra State Command, Okechukwu Ali, confirmed the incident but denied the involvement of the police in the incident.

He said the police were on a parade in Onitsha at the time of the incident but never shot members of the group.

The PPRO, however, said that all pro-Biafran groups remained banned according to the country’s constitution.

Efforts to get the reaction of the Commander Naval Outpost, Ogbaru, were not successful as his mobile telephone line remained unreachable.

But a source at the Naval Outpost described the claims of the Biafran activists as false, saying they should be able to produce the corpses of their allegedly slain members.

Suspected Boko Haram gunmen on horseback shot dead nearly 80 people in attacks on three villages in the North-East at the weekend, a vigilante and residents told AFP on Monday.

The attacks were the latest bloodbath in the six-year-old insurgency by the extremist group aimed at carving out an Islamic state in the volatile region.

Babakura Kolo, a vigilante fighting Boko Haram, said 68 people were killed in the attack on Baanu village in Borno state late on Friday while residents said another 11 people were shot dead in two other villages on Saturday and Sunday.

“Reports reached us of an attack on Baanu village late Friday where Boko Haram gunmen riding on horses opened fire on the village. Sixty-eight people were killed in the attack,” Kolo told AFP.

He said the gunmen stormed Baanu around 8.30 pm, shooting sporadically.

Baanu resident Aisami Ari who fled the attack to the state capital Maiduguri on Saturday, also confirmed the attack and the death toll.

“The attackers came on horses around 8.30 pm and began shooting sporadically. The whole village was thrown into confusion and everybody fled. We returned after they had gone and found out they had killed 68 people in the village,” he said.

“Most of us left the village on Saturday for fear of a fresh attack,” he added.

A government official, who demanded anonymity, however put the death toll in Baanu at 56.

Kolo also said four people were killed in another attack by the Islamists in Karnuwa village on Saturday.

“They shot dead four people in the village, including the chief imam of the village, his son and two neighbours,” he said.

Local resident Saleh Musa told AFP of a third attack on Hambagda on Sunday where they killed seven villagers and injured five others.

“The attackers arrived on horseback around 2:00 pm while people were praying in the mosque. They went straight to the mosque and opened fire on worshippers,” said Musa who later fled to the nearby town of Askira Uba.

“They killed seven people, while five others were injured. I was late for the afternoon prayers and I was at home preparing to go to the mosque and join in the prayers when the attack happened.”

Army spokesman in Maiduguri, Colonel Tukur Gusau, and Borno government spokesman Isa Umar Gusau said they could not immediately comment on the attacks.

Boko Haram has stepped up its attacks since Nigeria’s new President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in on May 29, vowing to crush the insurgency.

The wave of violence since the inauguration has claimed more than 1,000 lives, dealing a blow to a four-country offensive launched in February that had chalked up a number of victories against the hardline Islamists.

The extremists have carried out deadly ambushes across Nigeria’s borders and in recent weeks suicide bombers, many of them women, have staged several attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad.

Boko Haram, which is seeking to carve out a hardline Islamic state in northeast Nigeria, has killed some 15,000 people and displaced 1.5 million since 2009.

An 8,700-strong Multi-National Joint Task Force, drawing in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin, is expected to deploy against the insurgents soon."

A chieftain of All Progressives Con­gress (APC) in Akoko- Edo Lo­cal Government Area, Edo State, Captain Samson Amineshi (retd), has been shot dead by unknown gunmen.

The shooting reportedly took place Thursday evening along the Igarra-Okpe road.

There are however two ac­counts of how the incident occurred. One account said, Captain Amineshi had at­tended a social function in Igarra and was driving back home to Okpe in his car with two other occupants when he was shot.

He was said to have dodged the gunmen who re­portedly flagged him down and sped off not knowing an­other was metres away.

The deceased was said to have requested the other oc­cupants of the car to dock inside the vehicle when sud­denly the second group of gunmen reportedly appeared and fired directly at him.

He was said to have died on the spot while unknown amount of money was re­portedly collected from the occupants of the car.

But another version of the incident said it was a suspect­ed assassination, as the gun­men were said to have shot directly at Captain Amineshi and sped off in a motorbike which they had parked near­by.

The deceased, a former councillor in the council, was believed to be preparing for council election soon to be conducted in the state.

Family sources said the matter has been reported at the Igarra police station.

Spokesman for Edo State Police Command, DSP Ste­phen Onwochei could not be reached yesterday for confirmation, as several calls put to his mobile phone were unsuccessful."

Our correspondent learnt that the incident took place on Thursday when traders and buyers were busy observing their market day in Kirawa.

This is coming barely two days when suspected group of insurgents laid siege on Kolori and Ba’ana Imam villages of Damboa local government area killing 23 residents with injuring of many others.

Kirawa, a mountainous and remote area, which is located east of troubled Gwoza town and shares international border with francophone speaking communities of Cameroon Republic.

Sources told our correspondent that the insurgents who were armed with sophisticated weapons including AK47 rifles and petrol bombs invaded Kirawa on their market day and wrecked havoc leaving 53 people dead with over 100 injured.

“Fifty of our people were shot dead with over 100 injured when a group of terrorists invaded our market square. The market always attracted Cameroonian traders and customers.

“a day after the deadly attack on our market, two female suicide bombers who attempted to detonate their improvised explosive devices strapped on their bodies were arrested by combined team of residents and youth vigilante on Friday after Juma’at prayers”, an elder in Kirawa who did not want his name mentioned in the print for security reasons, said.

Another source who also hail from Kirawa, but reside in Maiduguri, the state capital told our correspondent that he received a distress call from one of his fleeing family members who crossed over to Cameroon Republic after the attack left scores of people in Kirawa dead and injured after setting ablaze many shops and houses, with looting of foodstuff and livestocks belonging to the residents.

” One of my family member from Kirawa called me on Friday evening that our community has been under deadly attack by insurgents, they had to flee to Cameroon before they got access to telecommunication services as most of the telecom masts in Kirawa and other communities around Behring mountains (Bayan Dutse) were destroyed last year by terrorists”, Mallam Ali Musa Kirawa, a resident of Maiduguri told our Correspondent.

At least three persons were confirmed killed while others sustained injuries when the Joint Task Force (Operation Pulo Shield), engaged suspected militants in a gun duel in Delta State, The Cable reports.

The commander of the force, Alani Okunlola, disclosed this in Warri during a press briefing on Thursday.

Parading a suspect allegedly arrested with various arms and ammunition, Okunlola said the operation took place in Benigboye community of Burutu Local Government Area of the state on September 5.

He said, “My men raided a militant camp in Benigboye. On sighting the troops, the suspects opened fire which led to a gun battle that lasted for 30 minutes before they fled the camp. In the follow up operation on September 6, my troops, on getting information on the hideout of the suspected militants that attacked Odimodi community, launched a search operation and apprehended one Ebiwame Lamia.”

Okunola added that during preliminary investigation, Lamia confessed that he was in the camp during the previous raid.

He quoted Lamia as saying that three persons died in the gun battle while some escaped with bullet wounds.

The commander said the JTF was in search of the fleeing suspects and urged the people to assist the troops with useful information that could lead to their arrest.

He listed weapons recovered from the camp to include medium machine gun, AK 47, light machine gun and AK 47 automatic rifle.

Okunola added that other weapons recovered were SMG, G3 riffles, one single barrel gun, and Improvised Explosive Device and an identity card.

Soldiers of the One Mechanised Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, have killed no fewer than 10 suspected terrorists in various joint operations code-named, “Operation Restore Peace II” in the North-West zone of the country.

Also in the operations, about 64 suspected terrorists and bandits were arrested.

Those arrested had been handed over to the police for further investigation and prosecution, according to the Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, One Division, Nigerian Army, Kaduna, Col. Usman Abdul.

The One Division spokesman also said 7,119 cattle, sheep and goats were recovered from rustlers and bandits who had been terrorising people from the zone.

The zone comprises of Jigawa, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Kaduna and Kano states, while the operations extended to Niger and Kogi states in the North-Central.

The operations were carried out by the combined team of the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Air Force, Police, Department of State Services as well as the Nigerian Customs, among others.

Abdul stated, “In Kaduna State and its immediate environs, the expanded security outfit involved in the operation have made recovery of 2,081 animals, like cattle, sheep and goats. Twenty-seven suspects were arrested and lots of weapons of different calibres were recovered from the bandits.

“In the axis of Sokoto, Zamfara, and Kebbi states, over 3,027 animals which included cattle, goats and sheep were recovered. Thirty-three suspected bandits were arrested with 11 weapons seized in the course of the operation. All the suspects were handed over to Zamfara DSS and the Police Command while the animals were handed over to the Zamfara State government officials.

“In the area covering Kano, Katsina and Jigawa states, the joint operation recovered a total of 2,011 animals, with four suspects arrested. Also, 10 bandits were killed during the encounters and eight assorted weapons recovered.

“The arrested suspects were handed over to the Katsina Police Command, while animals recovered were handed over to the Katsina State government officials.”

He added that since the commencement of the operations, confidence has been restored to the indigenes who had since resumed their normal farming and commercial activities.

Abdul noted that the army and other security agencies and the men of the state’s security outfit, code-named, “Operation Yaki” in Kaduna had through various operations been able to reduce and subdue the activities of bandits and insurgents.

He however warned supporters and sympathisers of the bandits against aiding and abetting their activities as the Division was ever determined to uproot them from the zone.

Meanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, on Thursday re-emphasised the commitment of the military to win the war against insurgents soon, insisting that the military is daily gaining more grounds against the Boko Haram insurgents.

Buratai gave this assurance while receiving five vehicles presented to the Multi-National Joint Task Force by Toyota Nigeria Limited at the Maimalari Barracks, Maiduguri.

He said he just returned from Gamboru-Ngala and so could tell Nigerians that the troops at the warfront were winning the battle against the insurgents.

Buratai said that the MNJTF needed logistics and moral support from corporate bodies and individuals to actualise its mandates. He therefore called on all well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to emulate Toyota Nigeria Limited.

While presenting the vehicles, the Managing Director, Toyota Limited Mr. Kunle Adeojo, said the gesture was part of the company’s corporate social responsibilities.

He called on other individuals and corporate organisations to assist the military in its move to rid the country of insurgency and and criminality.

In his speech, the commander of the MNJTF, Maj. Gen. Iliyasu Abba, said since the task force was established it had been trying to actualise its mandate.

No fewer than 20 persons were killed in the early hours of Monday in Zakupwang Fan Village of Foron district of Barkin Ladi Local Government Area, Plateau State, by unknown gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.

This, observers said, was in spite of the peace process initiated by the state Governor, Simon Lalong, to restore peace to the state.

Lalong had set up a 14-man committee comprising people from the two warring parties to find a lasting solution to the lingering war of attrition between Berom farmers and Fulani cattle rearers.

Monday’s attack, our correspondent learnt, was said to have been carried out between 12am and 1am on Monday.

Member representing Barkin-Ladi/Riyom Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Mr. Istifanus Gyang, who confirmed the incident in a statement, condemned the killings.

He said, “We have received with shock the Killings of 20 persons in the early hours of yesterday ( Monday) through violent attacks on seven villages in Barkin-Ladi Local Government Area .”

“The renewed attacks are least expected at a time when concerted peace efforts are ongoing between the Berom and the Fulani stakeholders.”

Gyang, while condemning the attacks, appealed to the Berom and Fulani stakeholders not to allow the attack defeat the ongoing peace efforts, adding that to do so would amount to awarding victory to those who had made blood-letting their vocation and daily delight.

He added that despite the setback, he remained committed to ensuring that Barkin-Ladi/Riyom Federal Constituency was rebranded from an axis of violence and bloodshed to one of peace and prosperity.

The lawmaker also called on the Special Task Force to live up to its upgraded status of providing a safe haven for all communities in the state, especially in his constituency.

From Petrus Obi, Enugu

The Chief Imam of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) Central Mosque, Sheik Adam Idoko, has been kidnapped by gunmen.

Idoko, who is also the deputy secretary-general of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) was kidnapped five days ago.

He was reportedly whisked away from his hometown, Ogrute Enugu-Ezike in Igbo-Eze North Council Area of Enugu State, where he was attending a meeting.

Already, the kidnappers, according to a source close to the mosque, have placed a N20million ransom tag on the chief Imam.

The source, who would not want his name in print, however, stated that such amount couldn’t be raised because the mosque does not have it.

He said: “We don’t have that kind of money. They should remember that Sheik Idoko is not a politician or a business tycoon. He is working for God.”

“Till now, I am still surprised why the Imam, who devoted himself to the work of God should be a target for kidnap. If the UNN central mosque has that kind of money, we would have finished the mosque we started building for the past four years.”

Musa Mohammed, a Muslim faithful, described the N20million ransom demanded by the kidnappers as unfortunate and outrageous.

He appealed to the kidnappers to release him unconditionally because he works for God.

Also, Usman Bello, another faithful, urged the kidnappers to respect Allah and set the cleric free, adding: “It is a serious abomination to manhandle those who are doing the work of Allah. We have been praying to Allah to touch their minds so that they will release him unconditionally. We do not know anywhere to get N20m for ransom.”

When contacted, the spokesman of the Enugu State Police command, DSP Ebere Amaraizu, said the command was working hard to secure the chief Imam’s release and arrest those behind the act."

The source added that the hoodlums shot sporadically to scare people as they took off from the bank.

The indiscriminate shooting by the fleeing robbers was said to have created a pandemonium in the area as passers-bye, street hawkers and other residents ran in different directions to escape being caught in the fire of the invaders.

Confirming the incident to SUNDAY PUNCH, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ismaila Numan, said the kidnapper, who was shot dead in a gun battle with the police was a second-year National Diploma student of architecture at the institution.

Numan said, “The command received a distress call and swung into action to track down the suspected kidnappers.”

According to him, the gang spotted the police and took to their heels.

He admonished parents in the state to ensure that their children were engaged in school activities rather than social vices.

The police PRO added that the vehicle which the suspects used for the operation was impounded by the police.

He also said investigation had since commenced to track down the remaining members of the gang and ensure that the entire polytechnic environment was freed from cultism and activities of kidnappers.

A source from the institution as of the time of filling this report told SUNDAY PUNCH that the incident took place outside the school gate.

From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure, Ndubuisi Orji and Sola Ojo, Kaduna

Elder statesman and National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Olu Falae was yesterday, abducted by some hoodlums in Akure, the Ondo State capital.

Falae, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, was reportedly kidnapped on his way to his farm located in Ilado Village in Akure North Local Government Area of the state.

It was gathered that the suspected kidnappers trailed Falae from his residence in Akure to his farm before he was kidnapped.

National Publicity Secretary of the SDP, a party founded by Falae, Mr. Remi Olayiwola, who spoke with newsmen at the residence of Falae confirmed that he was kidnapped on his farm.

It was, however, not certain whether or not Falae was alone when he was arrested, but a source said he left home with one other person.

Falae, whose birthday was on September 20, was said to have been having issues with some herdsmen around his farm.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the state Police command, Mr. Wole Ogodo, who confirmed the incident, said 50 mobile policemen had been deployed to the farm.

Ogodo also confirmed that Falae had been having serious issues with herdsmen around his farm.

Meanwhile, the residence of Chief Falae located in Oba-Ile area of Akure was yesterday besieged by sympathisers, who thronged the house to sympathise with the family on the abduction of the patriarch of the family. His wife disclosed that a special prayer was said to have been held for the family.

She also told newsmen that her husband’s abductors have made contact and were demanding N100 million as ransom.

Mrs. Falae said the abductors asked the family to pay the ransom within three days.

She said one of the suspected abductors, who spoke with a member of the family on telephone assured that her husband will be released as soon as the money was paid to them between Tuesday and Thursday.

Mrs. Falae, however pleaded with them to release her husband unconditionally as the family could not afford to pay the ransom.

She added the former finance minister was not as rich as many people think, and therefore pleaded for his unconditional release.

It was also gathered last night that hunters in Akure had been deployed to Falae’s farm where he was reportedly kidnapped.

The hunters, it was learnt, have started working with the Police officers earlier deployed to the farm.

Chief Olu Falae’s political party, Social Democratic Party (SDP) has condemned his abduction and demanded his immediate and unconditional release.

National Publicity Secretary of the party, Dr. Abdul Isiaq, dismissed reports that the 77 year-old politician was at loggerheads with anybody “either in business or politics.”

Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has condemned the abduction of Chief Olu Falae, saying it was not only unacceptable but also an exceptionally dangerous development. “I say this because he is not only an elder-statesman of our country but, he is also one of the most revered leaders of Afenifere and the South-West. We cannot sit by idly and watch our leaders and elders being endangered, shamed and humiliated in this way.”

He said: “It is governments job to keep us all safe and secure and they are failing in that duty. Let it be clearly understood that if anything happens to him and if he doesn’t come home hale and hearty we will hold the Federal Government responsible and there will be consequences.”

A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Ebonyi State, Chief Henry Ude also condemned Falae’s abductors.

Ude, who expressed shock at the ugly development, told Daily Sun yesterday that the kidnap of Falae, was worrisome.

Recalling his contact with Falae, when they were both detained at the Force CID Alagbon, during the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) agitation for the enthronement of democracy in Nigeria, Ude described the former SGF as a very peaceful man, who has contributed meaningfully to the development of the country.

Meanwhile, the residence of Chief Falae located in Oba-Ile area of Akure was yesterday besieged by sympathizers who thronged the house to sympathize with the family on the abduction of the patriarch of the

family. His wife disclosed that a special prayer was said to have been held for the family.

The wife of the abducted Politician, Mrs Rachael Falae however refused to speak with our Correspondent, His wife disclosed that a special prayer was said to have been held for the family.

Some of the sympathizers at the Falae’s residence include Politicians,government officials, neighbours and traditional chiefs of Akure, his hometown. Falae was initially scheduled to celebrate his 77th birthday yesterday

but the arrangement eventually changed."

The paramount ruler of Ogbogoro community, Yenagoa Local Government, Bayelsa State, His Royal Highness G.G. Igodo, has escaped being abducted by six unknown gunmen.

But a teenager, Alex ThankGod, was not so lucky, as he was said to be shot by the suspected kidnappers after their failed attempt to abduct Igodo.

It was learnt that the gunmen had stormed the residence of the monarch, who until recently, was the Chairman of the Bayelsa State Council of Traditional Rulers, about 10pm on Saturday.

It was further learnt that the gunmen could not actualise their mission of seizing their target due to the information provided by members of the community to the police.

The police were said to have quickly responded to the distress call by the community members and stormed the residence of the monarch which is about one kilometre from Yenagoa metropolis.

An eyewitness, who craved anonymity, said when some policemen arrived, the gunmen abandoned their target and started shooting to scare residents.

He said it was in the process that the 18-year-old boy, ThankGod, was shot and injured before the bandits escaped.

The Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa State Command, Mr. Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident.

Butswat said, “On Saturday, September 19, 2015, at about 2200hrs, six unknown gunmen stormed the residence of His Royal Highness G.G Igodo, in Ogbogoro Community, in Yenagoa LGA, to abduct him.

“Members of the community alerted the Police and patrol teams were deployed in the area promptly. The hoodlums, in a bid to escape, shot and injured one Alex ThankGod 18 years old and a member of the community on his hands and stomach.

“The victim was taken to the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa, and he is responding to treatment.”

The police spokesman said efforts had been intensified to arrest the hoodlums who escaped with bullet wounds through the waterways."

The District Head of Allawa in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State, his brother and 33 others have been killed by gunmen, who invaded the village on Tuesday night.

Our correspondent learnt that a Police Inspector in the area was also killed in the attack.

The attackers, who were said to be armed with sophisticated weapons, were believed to be Fulani herdsmen while an unconfirmed report suggested that the invaders could be fleeing Boko Haram members, who might have been dislodged from their hideout in Sambisa Forest.

It was gathered that the attackers also set more than 25 houses on fire and injured several other villagers before fleeing into the bush in an attack said to have lasted about two hours.

Scores of the villagers are now displaced as a result of the attack.

Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Bala Elikana, who confirmed the incident, expressed shock and sadness over the loss of innocent lives.

Elikana, however, said the command had not been able to confirm the number of casualty, admitting that a policeman was among those killed.

He added that the incident happened at night, explaining that as a result of lack of communication between Allawa and other parts of the state, distress call could not reach security agencies on time.

The PPRO stated that the Commissioner of Police, Alhaji Abubakar Marafa, had dispatched the Divisional Police Officer in Kagara and the Police Area Commander in Minna to the troubled village to assess the situation.

Troops of the Nigerian Army have been on the ground in the Shiroro Local Government Area, battling the menace of cow theft, but it could not be explained how the murderers evaded the soldiers."

At least 17 fighters from the Nigerian Islamic extremist group Boko Haram have died in clashes with Cameroon troops in the border town of Amchide, informed sources said Tuesday.

In the nearby village of Gouzoudou meanwhile two women carried out a botched suicide attack, injuring two farmers.

“Fifteen Boko Haram (fighters) were killed Tuesday and several others injured,” a source close to regional authorities told AFP after the clash.

Two further members of the group, which is affiliated to Islamic State, died in a Monday night confrontation with soldiers, the source added, saying the army did not incur any casualties.

A security source who did not wish to be identified indicated that “Boko Haram made an incursion into Amchide yesterday” but were pushed back by Cameroonian troops.

The source added they returned Tuesday but were likewise repulsed.

Amchide is just over the border from the Nigerian city of Banki, which has been occupied for around a year by Boko Haram and which Nigerian troops are preparing to retake, according to Cameroonian sources.

At the entrance to Gouzoudou village, which is also located in Cameroon’s far north, two female suicide bombers blew themselves up, a security source told AFP.

“The two suicide attackers appeared to have been aiming to blow themselves up on Monday, which is market day in the village, but it was guarded by the security forces,” a source close to the authorities said.

The two women hid and carried out the attack at dawn Tuesday.

“Two people who were on their way to the fields were wounded,” the source added.

More than 100 people have been killed in a total of 13 suicide attacks by Boko Haram in Cameroon’s far north since July.

Troops from both Nigeria and Cameroon belong to a multinational regional joint task also comprising forces from Benin, Chad and Niger tasked with driving back Boko Haram as it seeks to spread its sphere of influence.

The extremists have killed around 15,000 people in a six-year insurgency which has left more than two million homeless."

The gunmen, who were said to have stormed the communities at about 4am, overpowered youths and policemen deployed in the areas before killing their victims.

A source from the area said while eight persons were mowed down by the attackers in Obrikom, five persons also lost their lives in similar circumstance in Omoku.

It was gathered that the operation, which lasted till noon, had turned Obikom to a ghost town as residents deserted the area for fear further attacks.

An eyewitness told our correspondent that the gunmen had disarmed some Obrikom youths, who were members of a vigilante group before shooting their way into the town.

“It looked like an inter-cult war and they operated from 4am to noon today (Thursday) after they had overpowered policemen and some youths that were on guard in Obrikom town.

“We learnt that eight person were killed on Obikom during the attack. There was also another attack in Omoku, where five persons were killed. In Obrikom, the entire place is currently like a ghost town.

“People have deserted the area because they are afraid that the gunmen may come back again. We were told that they were on a reprisal, but we are not sure as of this moment I am speaking with you,” the eyewitness, who is an indigene of the area, said in a telephone interview.

Also, a teacher in one of the secondary schools in Omoku said he had to flee the teachers’ lodge and dash down to Port Harcourt as a result of the shooting in the area.

Barely 24 hours after the re­lease of the N a t i o n a l Chairman of the So­cial Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Olu Falae by his abductors, a re­nowned pastor in Ondo State, Japhet Obafemi has been kidnapped.

Obafemi, who is the Pastor in charge of The Apostolic Faith, Ikare Akoko in Akoko North East Local Government Area of the state, was re­portedly kidnapped yes­terday by gunmen.

Fleeing members of the Boko Haram sect have destroyed over 60 houses in three villages in Adamawa State, a local hunter told our correspondent on the telephone on Sunday.

He gave the names of the three villages as Sabon Gari, Kafin Hausa and Dutse Biyu in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State.

He explained that the insurgents, who were fleeing from soldiers from their enclaves in Borno State, ransacked the villages, took away foodstuffs and other valuables and destroyed over 60 houses.

Madagali Local Government Area shares boundaries with Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State, which was one of the strongholds of the Boko Haram insurgents.

The local hunter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the insurgents might have been attracted to Madagali area because of its mountainous landscape which could shield them from the aerial and land attacks by the troops.

Another source in the area, Ibrahim Abu, said as soon as the villagers sighted the fleeing insurgents trooping into their villages on Saturday, they took to their heels for safety.

“They left everything at the mercy of the insurgents who went on rampage, burning down many houses in these villages without any challenge from any quarter,” he said.

Speaking on the incident to journalists, the Acting Brigade Commander of the 23rd Armored Brigade of the Nigerian Army Yola, Col. A.B.A. Popoola, in a telephone interview said though Madagali was under the control of another commanding officer in charge of 28 Task Force Battalion, Mubi, he was told by the commander that three villages were attacked and houses destroyed by the insurgents.

Popoola maintained that based on the report from the commander in charge of 28, Task Force Battalion, Mubi, no life was lost in the attack.

He said soldiers were now at the villages for assessment and provision of security for the people of the area.

Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army on Sunday appealed to Nigerians to team up with the military in its efforts to end the Boko Haram insurgency.

Making the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Maiduguri, Maj. Gen. Yushau Abubakar, the Theatre Commander, Operation “Lafiya Dole,” said one of the key roles the people could play was volunteering vital information.

Abubakar explained that the anti-terrorism war could not succeed through military operations alone.

“I want to inform all that this operation should not be seen as purely military; it should be seen as an inclusive peace operation, where everybody has a role to play.

“This battle can best be won at the quickest time with the cooperation of all stakeholders.

“We need information; we need cooperation; we need synergy, we need support; support in the sense that we have lots of Internally Displaced Persons, who I believe, good Nigerians, good organisations, either domestically or internationally, can always come to assist.

“While this is being done, the military is faced with the task of degrading, destroying and arresting the terrorists,” he said.

The commander said that wealthy individuals and corporate organisations should also assist by providing logistics to the military to aid its operations.

Daredevil suspected robbers struck in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on Tuesday and killed a police sergeant, identified as William Relomer, and two persons, who were occupants of a Toyota Tundra car.

The bandits immediately carted away an undisclosed sum of money left in the vehicle in an operation that lasted less than six minutes.

An eyewitness said the incident happened around Waterlines Bus-stop along the ever-busy Olu Obasanjo Way at about 12.05pm on Tuesday.

The PUNCH gathered that the huge sum of money, contained in a Ghana-must-go bag, belonged to Oyigbo Local Government Area.

It was learnt that the policeman and the two others (a driver and an Oyigbo LGA official) that were shot dead had gone to a new generation bank to withdraw the money.

The hoodlums had shot the police first ostensibly because he (police sergeant) was armed before killing the two other occupants of the vehicle.

It was revealed that the hoodlums had earlier parked their vehicle, a Toyota Camry, away from where they intended to hit their target as a result of the gridlock close to the State Transport Company on Olu Obasanjo Way.

“I think they deliberately parked at a distance from where they shot and killed the policeman and two other persons. After their operation, they raced to where they parked their vehicles and sped off.

“Surprising, the gridlock on the Olu Obasanjo Way suddenly disappeared and this gave the armed robbers enough space to escape, though nobody chased after them,” an eyewitness, who is a taxi driver, told our correspondent.

It was, however, gathered that the police, who were on duty on Olu Obasanjo Way and the Port Harcourt-Aba Expressway, were nowhere to be found as the guns from the hoodlums boomed.

Another eyewitness said, “They parked at the back because of traffic and trekked to where the Toyota Tundra car they attacked was. They killed the official, the policeman and the driver instantly. They then drove away because the traffic cleared off.”

Confirming the incident, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, in an interview with The PUNCH, said, “I am aware of the incident. But only Sergeant William Relomer, who happened to be in an escort vehicle, lost his life.”"

Ogun State PDP Chairman, Bayo Dayo

Pandemonium broke out on Tuesday at the Ogun State Election Petitions Tribunal, sitting in Isabo, Abeokuta, as suspected thugs flogged politicians who had converged on the court’s premises.

The attackers, who were armed with canes and other weapons, descended on some notable party chieftains.

Those flogged include supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party, including a former Chairman of Yewa North Local Government, Olusoji Eweje, Sesan Orelaja, and a former women leader of the Labour Party, Mrs. Omolola Soyombo.

The state PDP chairman, Bayo Dayo, and the National Auditor of the party, Alhaji Wole Adeyanju, were said to have narrowly escaped being whipped by the hoodlums.

The free-for-all began shortly after the chairman of the three-man panel, Justice Henry Olusiyi, reserved judgment in the case, in which the governorship candidate of the PDP, Prince Gboyega Isiaka, is challenging the election which returned Senator Ibikunle Amosun of the All Progressives Congress as the state governor for the second time.

Lawyers, other party faithful and journalists had to wait inside the courtroom because the court premises had been turned into a battlefield. The security operatives were overwhelmed by the hoodlums until they called for a reinforcement.

Consequently, more security operatives including men of the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police led by a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Bello Makwashi, stormed the tribunal to rescue the situation which persisted for more than one hour.

Earlier, counsel for all the parties had adopted their final written addresses and were allowed to address the court while respondents also replied on point of law.

The counsel for the Independent National Electoral Commission, Olusina Sofola (SAN), urged the court to strike out all grounds of the petition except two, saying the grounds violated Section 138 of the Electoral Act and were as such incompetent.

Sofola told the court that the reliefs sought in the substantive petition were inconsistent and that the only option for the court “is to throw out the whole petition.”

The counsel for the 2nd respondent, George Oyeniyi, who also prayed the court to dismiss the evidence of PW9 (Benjamin Ibikunle) for being an interested party, argued that the petitioners had abandoned their reliefs.

Oyeniyi described the case as hopeless.

The counsel for the 1st respondent, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), also said what the petitioners were attempting to do was to amend the substantive petition through the back door.

The petitioners had requested the court to cancel the election results in nine local councils and declare Isiaka the winner of the April 11, 2015 governorship poll or order for another election in those contentious local councils.

Meanwhile, the Director of Publicity of Gboyega Isiaka Campaign Organisation, Ifekayode Akinbode, has accused the APC supporters of masterminding the attack on the PDP leaders and supporters, describing it as “barbaric and senseless.”

But the state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Sola Lawal, refuted this claim, stressing that the party “is discipline and has respect for the rule of law and individual, so it is not right to accuse it of using thugs to unleash terror on anyone.”

GUNMEN yesterday ab­ducted Oba Adebisi Oba­demi, the traditional ruler of Apaa-Bunu community in Kabba-Bunu Local Government Area of Kogi State.

An eyewitness told Dai­ly Sun that the traditional ruler was abducted at about 7.30 a.m. yesterday on his way to Odo – Ape, a sub­urb community close to his domain.

The account said the gunmen, numbering about five and suspected to be Fulani herdsmen might have whisked the tradition­al ruler on a motorbike to an unknown destination.

While condemning the dastardly act, a prominent political leader in the area and a Senior Special As­sistant to Governor Idris Wada, Duro Meseko, said the spate of kidnapping in the area was getting alarm­ing and called on law en­forcement agents to be pro active in their activities.

Meseko, who also called on the police authorities to establish a permanent po­lice station in the area also decried the activities of Fulani herdsmen, who he alleged were frequently fo­menting trouble in the area.

The governor’s aide also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly address the issue of kidnapping in the country, saying law abiding citizens were now living in fear.

A source close to the Commissioner of Police, Emmanuel Ojukwu, con­firmed the incident but blamed the people in the area for allowing kidnap­ping to thrive in the area.

The source said when the police made attempts in the previous kidnap incidents to launch an attack on the hide out of the kidnappers in the area, the same peo­ple allegedly pleaded that they would rather pay the ransom to the kidnappers than exposing the victims to any form of hurt, add­ing that it makes the police helpless.

The source, however, quoted the CP to have vowed to flush out crimi­nals in the area even as he urged residents to report any suspicious movement in the area, saying the po­lice would not tolerate any incident of break down of law and order.

Meanwhile, as the time of filing this report, no ran­som had been demanded by the abductors."

The village is the hometown of former acting governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri.

Kirchinga, a village in Madagali Local Government of Adamawa state, which shares border with the dreaded Sambisa forest, was one of the areas once annexed by Boko Haram insurgents last year.

It was however later cleared of terrorists after Boko Haram was routed by Nigerian troops in a counter insurgency operation.

A fleeing resident of the village, Ahmad Musa, in a telephone interview, said the insurgents struck the village at about 12:30am on Thursday and started firing sporadic shots while razing down buildings, making residents to flee into nearby bushes.

The resident said the insurgents slaughtered five trapped people, including three women and two men.

"" We are now in deep sorrow,"" Mr. Musa lamented.

According to him, the insurgents had a field day for many hours as they operated unchallenged due to complete absence of security personnel in the area.

Another resident of the area, John Apagwu, accused the government of leaving them to their own fate, corroborating Mr. Musa's account that there was complete absence of security personnel in the area.

""We want the government to deploy more security personnel for us because as Nigerians the government owes us a duty to protect us,"" Mr. Apagwu said.

""The fact that our area share borders with Sambisa forest and Cameroon republic should have been enough reason why government must deploy security personnel to protect us. If the government does not take proactive measures to stem the ugly insurrection of insurgents into our domain, they will kill all of us.""

Mr. Apagwu added that already, people were fleeing the area en mass to Madagali for fear of their lives as they anticipated more attacks from the Boko Haram insurgents following the absence of security personnel in the area.

Confirming the incident, the member representing Michika/Madagali Federal constituency in the House of Representatives, Adamu Kamale, blamed the Federal Government for the wanton destruction of lives and properties.

Mr. Kamale accused the government of paying lip service to the security of the people of the area.

He noted that while other parts of Nigeria were in celebration mood over Nigeria's independence anniversary, his people were mourning the wanton massacre of their loved ones.

""We need more security personnel as our villages share borders with Sambisa forest,"" the lawmaker said.

Sani Usman

Boko Haram insurgents have killed over 34 people in Sajeri and Gwoza areas in Maiduguri, Borno State between Thursday and Friday.

Four female suicide bombers killed 13 people and injured 39 others in Sajeri while gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram members attacked Gwoza on Friday morning killing over 20 persons.

Confirming the development on Friday, the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Colonel Sani Usman, said that multiple explosions rocked the Sajeri area on Thursday, killing at least 13 persons and injuring 39 others.

Usman also confirmed that the injured victims of the attacks, which were carried out by four female suicide bombers, had been taken to the hospital.

He said, “There were bomb explosions at Sajeri, Maiduguri on Thursday. Troops, security, and emergency management were mobilised to the location. Although details are sketchy, four Boko Haram terrorists’ suicide bombers detonated their vests simultaneously.

“Three of them in the same area and the fourth detonated in front of a mosque. It has been confirmed that 14 people lost their lives and the 39 wounded people have been evacuated to the hospital.”

He, however, assured residents in the area that everything was being done to ensure their safety.

“We appeal to the people and residents in the affected area to remain calm. Everything is being done to secure lives and property,” he said.

Over 20 people were also said to have been killed when gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram insurgents attacked Gwoza in Maiduguri, on Friday.

The Executive Director, Stefanos Foundation, Mr. Mark Lipdo, who quoted military sources in an interview with Saturday PUNCH, said that the insurgents overran the town as early as 7.30am killing many people.

Gwoza was the first town to be declared Muslim caliphate by the insurgents on August 14, 2014, but it was later reclaimed by the military this year.

Lipdo expressed worry that the insurgents were still allowed to prowl about even when they had been chased out from some places.

He called on the military to maintain effective presence in places where the insurgents had been chased away from.

The attack on Gwoza came less than 24 hours after the insurgents attacked Kinchinga village in Madagali Local Government area of Adamawa State slitting the throats of five people.

Boko Haram insurgents have increasingly used suicide bombers to target civilians. On September 20, 2015, at least 117 people were killed in similar attacks in the city of Maiduguri.

The Boko Haram insurgency has also claimed more than 1,260 lives in the country since President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office on May 29, 2015.

Kurawa explained that the whereabouts of the kidnapped woman was still unknown as the kidnappers had yet to either contact the police or the family of the victim.

“We are doing everything humanly possible to trace her whereabouts and free her safely from her abductors.

“We are, however, soliciting the support of the public by rendering useful intelligence reports that may lead to the successful rescue of the kidnapped woman,” he added.

Her son, Kebbe, also confirmed the abduction of the mother.,

OPERATIVES of the Rivers State Police Command have killed two suspected members of a criminal gang terrorizing Port Harcourt residents.

While one of those killed during a gun duel with the police last week Thursday was a suspected kidnapper, the other that died as a result of gunshot injuries was an armed robber.

The State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Ahmad Mohammad, who was addressing newsmen on Monday while parading about 15 suspected armed robbers, kidnappers and cultists, said seven kidnapped victims were rescued by the operatives.

Mohammad also disclosed that five suspected cultists were arrested with various arms and ammunition, including two AK-47 rifles, six magazines and 131 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunition, recovered from them.

He identified the arrested cultists as Kingdom Okere, Chiboy Lucky London, Samuel Bassey, Emmanuel Patrick Ikedichi Nwachukwu and Samuel Osaro, adding that Osaro had confessed to be among the gang that kidnapped the son of the University of Port Harcourt Vice Chancellor, Mr. Ejira Lale.

On the rescue of the kidnapped victims, the state police spokesman said, “A case in hand was that of Mrs. Bunmi Shonoye, who was found chained on her legs at the kidnappers’ hideout along Rumuduru Road in Port Harcourt.

“One Obinna Ekezie (28) and Henry Enyi (28) were arrested during the rescue operation, while two AK-47 riffles, four magazines, 40 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunition and a Honda Accord with Registration Number NDN 43 JP were recovered at the scene.

“Cumulatively, 11 suspected kidnappers were arrested while one was fatally wounded within the last two weeks. Imagine the damage these firearms found with these sadists would have done,” Mohammad said.

He also disclosed that five stolen vehicles were recovered when operatives of the command raided a location on NTA Road, Port Harcourt and arrested one Sunny Ossai identified as the leader of a car snatching syndicate.

According to him, “Further interrogation of Sunny Ossai led our men to Abia State where five suspected stolen vehicles were recovered. The vehicles recovered are gold colour Toyota RAV4, grey colour Toyota Camry and silver colour Toyota Camry.

“Others are silver colour Honda EOD, wine colour Toyota Land Cruiser jeep and silver Toyota Lexus belonging to one Chief E. Amadi that was snatched at gunpoint along Obirikwerre. It was recovered by the operatives of the command on the 29th of September, 2015, at Awka, Anambra State."

•Heavy shooting, stray bullets kill mum, baby girl

By Chris Oji, Mosunmola Omokunga and Chioma Igbokwe

The peace of Festac Town in Mile 2 area of Lagos was shattered on Tuesday when 40 armed robbers stormed three banks located on 4th Avenue and carted away currencies in naira and dollars.

The hoodlums, however, left behind wailing, anguish and pain in the household of Mr. Peter Ndirika after a stray bullet shot by the robbers killed his wife, Jane Ebele and her one and a half year old baby, Masoma Ndisika.

The robbers, who operated for over two hours without restraint, and numbering about 40, reportedly accessed the banks through the canal in a speedboat and announced their presence by shooting sporadically into the air.

At the end of the operation, little Masoma laid dead having been hit in the neck by a stray bullet which had earlier hit her mother, Jane. The bullet, according to her neighbours penetrated her chest before hitting her daughter.

While Masoma died in their flat on Block 8, Flat 13 on 4th Avenue, her mother, Ebele died in the hospital she was rushed to for treatment.

Eye witnesses told Daily Sun that the robbers gained entry into the banks by blowing up the entrance with dynamite and the sound of the explosion sent panic across the vicinity.

Thereafter, it was two hours of chaos, fear, panic and pains. After robbing and looting the vaults of the two banks, they stormed another bank in the area.

It was also gathered that while the robbery lasted, the robbers who were armed with GMP riffles fired their guns sparodically to scare away policemen.

The robbers eventually succeeded in carting away about N28 million. But according to witnesses, the robbers went away with cash in foreign and local currencies in Ghana-must-go bags. Some eyewitnesses said while the robbers fled the scene, some bundles of dollar notes and naira fell from the Ghana-must-go bags. “Can you imagine, they took the dollar notes and left naira notes!”

Daily Sun also gathered that, that same morning, local bureau de change dealers on 22 Road in FESTAC Town were robbed before the attacks on the banks

As the robbers shot bullets into in the air, there was response from other quarters (speculated to have come from men of the Odua Peoples Congress (OPC) which temporarily destabilised the robbers. The eyewitnesses said that the response infuriated the robbers who shot sporadically into the air and in different directions as a form of defence.

They eventually escaped with a speedboat through the canal.

However, at the Ndirika’s residence in Flat 13, it was anguish and pain all through.

Ndirika reportedly worked at Alimosho Local Government area as a nurse and was on afternoon duty preparatory to going to work when the unfortunate incident happened.

Mrs Uju Darlington, a family friend, who was also in the same house when the incident happened, narrated the story to Daily Sun. She said they were all at home when the shootings started and so, they all “ran for cover and immediately, shut the door and laid down on the floor as a safety measure.

“But, while they were lying on the floor, the woman heard the voice of her baby who was in the room. She dashed into the room to comfort her.

“As was cuddling her baby, in less than a minute, the woman just screamed and threw the baby on the bed. As she screamed, there was a flash of fire in the house.

“Everyone in the house ran to her rescue and the woman started shouting ‘please help me fast…, please help me fast, oh God I’m dying o, I’m dying’. The woman was in pains and in the pool of her own blood.

“By the time paramedics arrived to administer First Aid, they discovered a deep cut on her shoulders and her chest, which suggested that the bullet ripped her chest to get to her shoulders.

“Amidst the pandemonium, and since the shootings was ongoing, there was no way that they could rush the woman to the hospital. First aid was performed on her by dressing the wound and covering it. We waited while the shootings continued for another one hour. At that point, the baby was no longer crying but in the pool of her own blood…

“When they finally arrived at the hospital, Masoma was confirmed dead on the spot and her corpse was brought back home. But her mother was admitted in the hospital where she later died.”

The bereaved, Mr. Peter Ndirika, has been inconsolable since yesterday morning. It was gathered that he had left for work when the incident happened. However, neighbours broke the news to him.

Not less than 10 minutes after the robbers left, heavily armed policemen, came to the scene in about 20 police vehicles and an ASP amour tank. Even the Area Commander of FESTAC Town, Mr. Frank Mba, was also on ground.

In a jiffy, a huge crowd had besieged the area to have a glimpse of what happened.

Although Mba led his men to the scene, a huge crowd had besieged the area and was almost unruly, when news filtered in about the death of Masoma and her mother. Police reportedly called for reinforcement with naval officers and soldiers who restored calm.

He told Daily Sun that, “at about 8.25, the Command received information of sporadic shooting along 4th Avenue. A joint team of policemen from Area E and FESTAC Division promptly responded to the incident.

“On arrival, the policemen engaged the robbers numbering over 40 all in military camouflage and armed to the teeth in fierce gun battle. Not withstanding the numerical disadvantage of the police strength at the beginning of the operation, the hot exchange of fire, forced the robbers who were simultaneously robbing two banks to abandon the operation.

“The police action equally forced the robbers to abandon N27 715.921.74k, which was later recovered by the police and transferred under armed escort safe keeping into another bank. Police actions also forced the armed robbers to abandon 240 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunition.

“The robbers later retreated to the water front from where they fled in speed boats

The scene of crime has been condoned off while investigating has since commenced.”

A Police source told Crime watch Today, however, “we were deceived by the robbers. They came with two vehicles believed to have been be snatched. “We didn’t confront them in order to avoid casualties. We called for reinforcement, barricaded the roads, not knowing that the hoodlums had already parked two speed boats in the canal near 6th Avenue.

“As we were chased them, they drove towards 6th Avenue and escaped in two boats. It was a well organised robbery.It was a big lesson to us.

“I must confess, the robbers were armed with GMP riffles and dynamites. The two persons the robbers shot dead were not killed at the scene.They were hit by stray bullets but, there has not been any official report about the deaths…”"

From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan

One person was feared dead and 15 others injured in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, during a bloody clash between members of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Tipper Drivers Association.

The clash was said to have occurred at Omi-Adio Motor Park, along Ibadan-Abeokuta Expressway. The fracas, it was gathered, began on Sunday night during a party and continued till Monday.

The middle aged man that was killed was a commercial bus driver, who was said to have been hacked to death with machete during the fracas.

The suspected thugs reportedly brandished dangerous weapons, such as cutlasses, knives, iron rods and clubs. They were said to have smashed windscreens of, at least, 10 vehicles along Ibadan-Abeokuta Expressway. Also, innocent members of the public were said to have been equally assaulted.

The rioters barricaded the highway, as residents and shop owners in the area fled the vicinity for safety.

Men of the state special security outfit, Operation Burst, and team of anti-riot policemen from Iyaganku Police Station, stormed the scene and quelled the mayhem.

Those people that sustained varying degrees of injury were rushed to Alaafia Hospital in Apata. Those that were rejected by the hospital were taken to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan.

Investigation revealed the riot was a reaction to the road accident that claimed the lives of three persons opposite a hotel along Ibadan-Abeokuta Expressway two weeks ago. The accident involved a commercial bus and a truck. Three among the occupants of the bus, including the driver were killed instantly while others were injured.

A bus driver, who simply identified himself as Musiliu, accused many tipper and truck drivers of recklessness on the road. He alleged that many members of the NURTW had been killed by the tipper drivers on the road.

“The truck driver, who allegedly drove the truck that killed three people was sighted at the party at Omi garage on Sunday. Members of NURTW challenged him and they mobilised to avenge the death of their colleague,” he said.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Mr. Adekunle Ajisebutu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), confirmed the Monday fracas, but said no live was lost.

I wanted to raise money for my girlfriend’s birthday –Suspect

From Emmanuel Adeyemi, Lokoja

An armed robbery suspect, Yakubu Usman, has lamented that inordinate lust pushed him to join an armed robbery gang, with the intention of raising money to organise a birthday bash for his girlfriend.

Usman, who was one of the five armed robbery suspects arrested recently by the Kogi State Police Command, said in order to prove that he truly loved his girlfriend, he had no option but to join a robbery syndicate that specialised in robbing banks.

“I was actually pushed to join this deadly gang because of Salamatu, my girlfriend, who is marking her birthday later this month. I wanted to use part of the proceeds to organise a one-in-town birthday bash for her, simply because I wanted to impress her that I am a big boy.

“ You see, I am from a poor home, but I think I could use robbery to cover up my poverty. So, I tried to impress this babe, who actually felt I was one of the big boys in town.

“But, I feel sorry for myself now, that I allowed her lust to bring me to this mess. I now know that life itself has no meaning for a person behind the bars,” he said in tears.

Parading the suspects, the state police commissioner, Emmanuel Ojukwu, said the suspect was only trying to shed crocodile tears, stressing that he was a hardened criminal, who belonged to a gang that specialised in robbing banks. He said that the gang might have been responsible for series of bank robberies in the state.

The CP said on October 6, 2015, he gathered through credible intelligence that a gang of notorious armed robbers were planning to attack a bank in Ayingba and its environs.

He said based on a tip-off, operatives of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) in the state led by their commander, Ayeni Oluwadare, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), immediately swung into action and invaded their hideout.

He said five of the suspects were arrested while one Emmanuel Ometa, the gang leader, escaped with an AK 47 rifle. He gave the names of those arrested as James Adaje, Godwin Ekeji, Yakubu Usman, Musa Dalisu and Monday Adejoh.

Items recovered included one locally made barreta pistol, one axe, cutlass, some quantity of weeds suspected to be Indian hemp, 11 Sim cards, among others.

In a related development the Police Commissioner also paraded 23 other suspects arrested for armed robbery, illegal gun manufacturing and political thuggery at Ejule, Ofu Local Government Area of the state.

He said six guns, including AK47 rifle, locally made guns, bullet proof vests, charms, ammunitions, weeds suspected to be Indian hemp and a Ford Galaxy bus with registration number Oyo AH 5095 HK were recovered from the hoodlums.

The CP said that all the suspects would be charged to court as soon as the police complete their investigations.

Outrage over report on brutalised student by police officer

• CDHR, NANS, others demand immediate dismissal of officers involved

From Segun Olatunji, Abeokuta

The Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR)and the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) yesterday demanded the dismissal of the police officer, who allegedly brutalised a 25-year-old student of the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Peter Taiwo.

NANS, which threatened a nationwide protest against the police, also demanded a N50 million compensation to the victim.

Also, the authorities of MAPOLY have vowed to use everything at its disposal to ensure the prosecution of the police officer alleged to have brutalised its student. The institution has also pledged to pay the hospital bills for the treatment of the victim.

Taiwo, a Higher National Diploma 1 student of Computer Science was allegedly attacked by Emmanuel Ogundaisi, an Assistant Superintendent of Police attached to the Adigbe Police Station at about 11:00pm last Thursday at Olatidoye Street in the Oluwo area of the state capital.

As at Monday afternoon, the victim, who had become frail was in a state of near-coma.

But the CDHR has asked police authorities to dismiss Ogundaisi and his accomplice, Corporal Samuel Ajayi alleged to have been the rider of the motorcycle on which the two policemen rode to commit the alleged crime.

The Ogun State Chairman of the CDHR, Olayinka Folarin, said that the police officer and his accomplice had gone far beyond their briefs as law enforcement officers and should be made to face the wrath of the law.

Folarin warned that the police high command should urgently take the necessary punitive actions against the erring police officers to avoid a mass action from ordinary Nigerians. He added that the CDHR would use all necessary legal means to ensure that justice is done in the matter.

The CDHR noted that brutality against innocent citizens by policemen had become unacceptable.

Folarin said: “It is highly condemnable that such an injustice can be meted out to a human being and the police who are supposed to be the custodian of human rights are now the one violating human rights. We have condemned it in the society and we are patiently waiting for the Police Force to do the needful.

“Our demand is as follows: An immediate dismissal of the police officers who perpetrated this evil, ASP Emmanuel Ogundaisi and corporal Samuel Ajayi. These police officers have violated the IGP order, which states that every police operation should be embarked on with an identified police vehicle and not with a bike.

“So, there is every need for the police force to take necessary actions on this police officers to avoid the masses revolt.”

NANS in a petition to the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abdulmajid Ali demanded the immediate arrest and prosecution of the officers involved.

The students in the petition signed by the NANS Chairman in the state, Dotun Opaleye however threatened to organise a nationwide protest against the police if its demands were not met in the next 48 hours.

NANS therefore asked for N50million compensation for the victim as well as the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the police and the students in the state assuring that such an incident would no longer occur.

“This act contravenes Article Three (3) and five (5) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1984 in Paris. Mr. Taiwo Peter’s only crime was that he was a Nigerian citizen.

“As we write this letter, Mr. Taiwo Peter cannot speak intelligently anymore as we suspect that the vicious blows to the head might have reconfigured the brains operation. He has also suffered a horrific psychological trauma capable of destroying his psychological balance. We still need to subject him to more medical checks,” the petition read.

Also condemning the alleged brutality against Taiwo, MAPOLY authorities said it had received a formal petition from the institution’s Students Union Government concerning the incident.

It also disclosed that it had already contacted the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abdulmajid Ali to ensure that the offending police officer faced the wrath of the law over his action.

The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Sulaiman Adebiyi said that the authorities of the polytechnic had taken official note of the incident and was already taking the necessary steps and actions to ensure that justice was done in the matter.

Adebiyi added that the management of the institution had already instructed the Head of the Department of the brutalised student to liase with the polytechnic’s Chief Nursing Officer to ensure the victim had access to adequate medical attention.

The MAPOLY spokesman however urged the students of the institution to remain calm and law-abiding while the authorities addressed the matter."

It was later we discovered that occupants of the house, including two pregnant women who were just in their nightdresses were whisked away. I am the elder sister of Bilikisu Sani who just got married.

“We have gone to 1 Divi­sion, but we were told they did not have anybody with such description in their custody. We also went to office of DSS as well as the police headquarters here in Kaduna where we heard the same story.

“We decided to come to NUJ because we do not know whereabouts of our people. We do not even know on what grounds the arrest was made. All we know is that the men were in security uniforms and the operation lasted for about five hours.”

Contacted, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Kaduna Police Command, DSP Zubairu Abubakar, said he was unaware of any joint operation on Monday, October 12, but promised to make contacts.

But about an hour later, he replied through a mobile message which simply read: “For any army operation, call their PRO pls. Thanks.”

Calling the Public Rela­tions Officer of 1 Divisional Army Headquarters, Ka­duna, Col. A. O. Abdul, he also said he was not aware of any operation involving the army on the said date. He promised to make con­tact and get back to this re­porter but he never did.

However, Public Rela­tions Officer of Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Kaduna State Command, ASCII, Orndiir Terzungwe, con­firmed that Army did called for reinforcement on that day, but could not ascertain whether it was for the case under review."

What could have been a major disaster was averted Sunday in troubled Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, Northeast Nigeria as a vehicle conveying four suspected suicide bombers heading for the town accidentally exploded before it could reach its destination.

Though the departure point of the vehicle could not be ascertained last night, all that was revealed was that it was eight kilometres away from Maiduguri before it suddenly exploded and went up in flames killing all the four occupants suspected to be suicide bombers on a mission to Maiduguri.

It was gathered that the explosion occurred on the highway around Njimtilo, and apart from the four persons in the Volkswagen Golf car headed for Maiduguri from ""God knows where"" there was no other casualty.

Confirming the attack to our correspondent in a text message, the information officer of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in the Northeast, Mallam AbdulKadir Ibrahim said ""there was aborted suicide bomb attack at Njimtilo today 25 October, 2015.

""The four suicide bombers came in a car (golf) around some minutes past 1:20pm. The car presumably exploded before they reached their target.

""All the four suicide bombers on board died. No innocent soul loss. No casualty recorded. Their remains is deposited in the mortuary at Borno State Specialist Hospital."""

They also blocked the Enugu-Makurdi Expressway yesterday, crippling vehicular movement.

The situation is causing serious tension among residents, who told journalists that they kept vigil throughout the night.

It was, however, gathered that though no life was lost in the sporadic shootings that lasted several hours, police vehicles, including a Hilux van and parts of a building were destroyed.

A source told our correspondent that trouble started when a team of policemen stormed a viewing centre and arrested some residents, a development that angered the youths.

A member representing Nsukka East constituency in Enugu State House of Assembly, Chinedu Nwamba, who confirmed the incident, re-echoed the claim that the police had been harassing his people, accusing them of being armed robbers and cultists, and extorting N5,000 from them.

In a telephone chat, Nwamba who did not confirm whether properties were vandalised said, “I have complained severally to the DPO over complaints from my people. I told the DPO that I’m not impeding him from doing his job, but that after arrest and investigation, he should release innocent people who were not found culpable of any crime unconditionally.�?

He further disclosed that on getting to the police station, the angry youths demanded immediate release of their brothers, a request the police turned down.

It was learnt that at that point, the youths went wild and started vandalising properties, even as they reportedly engaged the police in sporadic gunfire.

Also, early yesterday morning, they re-grouped and blocked the ever-busy Enugu-Makurdi Expressway. It took the intervention of the DPO of Nsukka Urban before they removed the roadblock.

In its reaction, the state police command said three cultists were arrested after the attack on the police station, which was allegedly led by a councillor."

There are fears in the camp of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the kidnap of Mr Koinpreye Douglas, a cousin of the APC governorship candidate and former governor, Timipre Sylva.

Recently, Madam Ebibafegha Dikoro Igiri, the 105-year-old mother of Sylva’s running mate, Wilberforce Igiri, was abducted from her home in Foroupa community in Southern Ijaw local government. She was released after about N13 million was allegedly paid as ransom.

Investigations indicated that Douglas was kidnapped on Monday afternoon along Ogbia-Brass waterways on his way to attend the APC governorship rally in Brass local government area. Mr Nathan Egba, Director of Media and Publicity of Sylva Campaign Organisation, who was in one of the boats, confirmed that Douglas was the only one seized from the ill-fated boat. The family is said to be apprehensive because the kidnappers are yet to make any contact with the family.

Sources in APC said chieftains of the party are applying for more security to protect their families as the state inches towards the December 5 governorship elections."

In the first incident, five members of the same family and a soldier were killed when two female suicide bombers struck at about 6 p.m. Saturday near a military base in the town of Dabanga, near the Nigerian border.

\""The explosives not only killed the terrorists, it also took away the lives of five people belonging to a single family,\"" said Col. Joseph Nouma, commander of Cameroon\'s counterterrorism forces.

The soldier died of his injuries overnight in a hospital, and a colleague was seriously wounded.

About two hours later, Boko Haram struck again in the village of Gouzoudou, close to the Nigerian border in Cameroon\'s north, killing five people, said Nouma.

\""They also burned down ten houses,\"" Nouma said.

Cameroon\'s Far North Region flanks northeast Nigeria, Boko Haram\'s heartland, and has become a regular target for the Islamist group\'s insurgents.

A week ago, at least six people were killed when suicide bombers struck the border town of Fotokol.

Boko Haram overtook ISIS to become the world\'s deadliest terror group last year, responsible for 6,644 deaths in 2014, according to the Global Terrorism Index, a report released earlier this month."

The deceased, Dieseye Dickson was reportedly shot dead in Odi community at about 11pm on Wednesday by the gunmen who were reportedly dressed in military uniform.

While a version of the report claimed that the deceased was shot dead during a shoot-out between Policemen and the gunmen, numbering about eight in a failed kidnap attempt of Chief Watson Ogoriba, a businessman and senior brother of the former member of the Federal House of Representatives, Hon. Warman Ogoriba. The leadership of the APC in the state through the Sylva/Igiri campaign Organisation alleged that the killing was carried out by suspected thugs hired by the PDP.

The Director of Media and Publicity of the Sylva/ Igiri campaign Organisation, Chief Nathan Egba, stated that the killing was wicked, unwarranted and provocative, calling on the police and other relevant agencies to wade into the matter and fish out the killers.

He said, “As at this morning, the corpse of Mr. Dickson, was still lying in a pool of his own blood where he was killed. Do note that this is the second killing being carried out by the PDP since the campaigns started. Recall that Mr. Andrew June, a ward chairman of our party in Ekeremor LGA was hacked to death. We condemned this act of desperation by the PDP to continually attack and intimidate our supporters.”

“This killing is wicked, unwarranted and provocative. The APC and the campaign organization has repeatedly called on the police and other security agencies to step up their patrol to forestall any further attack on the APC members. Killers of these people must not be allowed to go unpunished.”

A member of the Federal House of Representative representing Yenagoa/ Kolokuma/Opokuma Constituency, Hon.Douye Diri, however faulted the claim of Egba, saying that the incident, was a case of foiled kidnap attempt and not a party conflict.

A source within the local government Area also stated “It was a case of failed kidnap attempt. It is not about PDP or the APC. When the kidnappers arrived the community, the vigilante group alerted the Police in Kaima Divisional Command and they engaged the suspected kidnappers in a shoot-out. The victim may have been caught in a cross fire.” The source revealed that aside from the deceased, a woman was also hit in the buttocks by a stray bullet."

The Nigerian Army on Thurdaysaid its troops, deployed for the counter-insurgency in the troubled North-east, killed 49 Boko Haram insurgents within the last one week in a series of assaults in Borno State.



Also during the same period, the army said 150 persons who were being held by the insurgents as human shields in confrontation with them were rescued.



It also revealed that several arms, ammunition and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were recovered in the battle with the insurgents.

Addressing a press conference in Maiduguri, the Theatre Commander of the military counter-insurgency operation in the North-east, Operation Lafiya Dole, Maj. Gen. Yusha'u Abubakar, said the operation was carried out in various hideouts of the Islamists in the Bama-Fulka and Alagarno axis of Borno.



He said: “It is important to announce that our gallant troops conducted various operations along Bama-Fulka and Alagarno areas of Borno State, which yielded fruitful results in the ongoing fight against Boko Haram elements.



“During the episode, the troops had an encounter with some terrorists, who suffered serious casualties.

“In the Alagarno axis, 15 insurgents were gunned down, while 34 others were killed along Bama-Fulka Road. The troops have also rescued 150 people, mostly old men and women, as well as children.



“The captives who were abducted from their homes by the terrorists, were being held as human shields.”

He added that recent successes recorded by the troops followed the serious setback suffered by the terrorists after losing their major enclaves.



“Let me make it clear that Boko Haram has been degraded and weakened by the military after a series of assaults, and the morale of our troops has been very high.



“Nigerians are very impressed by the performance of the task force in recent times. The military has no time to waste but to crush the remnants of the terrorists and move forward,” Abubakar said.



Abubakar however regretted that a convoy of fleeing Boko Haram insurgents ambushed a convoy of military vehicles along Maiduguri-Bama Road on Tuesday, killing an officer and soldier."

Wole Ayodele in Jalingo

Six people have been killed at Bela village, Bornon Kurku area of Bali local government in Taraba state by youths protesting the killing of two people during a robbery incident by unknown gunmen. They were reportedly killed during the past week.

The protesting youths, according to THISDAY investigations, went after the victims on the suspicion that they or their kinsmen were masterminds of a robbery incident along Chediya/Borno Kurku road on the fateful day which claimed two lives.



The robbery attack was suspected to have been carried out by members of the Tiv community in the area prompting the protesting youths to unleash mayhem on the victims using guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons.



The deadly protests, THISDAY gathered, was ignited when the corpses of the two people killed during the robbery incident were brought to Bela and obviously infuriated by the sights of the corpses, the youths descended on the Tiv people who were part of the crowd that gathered to see the slain men.



An eyewitness, who escaped being killed during the mayhem by whiskers, Zasha Terpase told journalists that the protesting youths were led by the son of the district head of Bela, Maiaungwa Iliyasu whom he alleged personally shot three of the victims.



According to Terpase “On seeing the corpses, he went into his room and came out with a gun and shouting Allah Akbar Allah Akbar, shot and killed three people instantly. We all ran for safety but they pursued and killed three others.



“I escaped by the whiskers, because we all came to see the corpses and suddenly we the Tiv people became targets. It’s unfortunate that anything bad that happens, they usually blame it on us”, he added.



Lamenting the attack, Terpase, who described the Tiv people in the area as peace loving, noted that they recently returned to the village following their displacement by Fulani herdsmen last year and were just managing to survive, insisting that no Tiv man in the area would want to go and cause trouble.



THISDAY investigations further revealed that the corpses of the victims were butchered by the irate youths and dumped in a nearby pond while many of the youths were said to have fled the village to avoid being arrested by security agents.



The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Joseph Kwaji confirmed the killing of the two Fulanis during the robbery incident saying investigations are ongoing to bring the perpetrators to book. He however stated that he was yet to receive the report on the protest that led to the killing of the six Tiv people and therefore could not comment on it."

Correspondent,Ado-Ekiti

A Divisional Police Officer was nearly lynched when members of Drivers Union protested the killing of one of their members by armed robbers in Ekiti

The unfortunate incident which occurred at Aramoko Ekiti, Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti in the early hours of Wednesday .

The victim ,Toyin Philips , was the driver of an 18- seater owned by the late Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Mr Omolafe Aderiye, who was assassinated in September, 2014 by unknown gunmen, which fuelled suspicion that the

driver could have died under similar circumstance.

The incident, which happened few metres away from a police checkpoint

along Aramoko-Igede highway at about 7 am ,had provoked members of

the National Union of Road Transport Workers, who staged a protest

against what they described as alleged police complicity in the

robbery .

The visibly enraged drivers, according to reliable sources, were said

to have descended heavily on the Divisional Police Officer in the

Council, Mr Anthony Okpaleye, stripped him naked and destroyed two

police vans during the rampage.

Rattled by the widespread suspicion that the matter was more of an

assassination than robbery, the State government hurriedly summoned a

security meeting, chaired by the Deputy Governor, Dr Kolapo Olusola.

The meeting was attended by the Commissioner of Police, Mr Etop James,

Director of Department of State Services, Mr Duke Fubara , other

security heads and the driver unions.

Recounting how the robbery took place at the meeting, the NURTW

Chairman in Ekiti, Mr Adekola Clement , revealed that the driver had

just driven a few metres away from a police checkpoint when robbers

were said to have emerged from both sides of the road and rained

bullets on the vehicle.

“The driver was said to have lost control when the bullets hit him in

the chest and the bus rolled into the bush. We appeal that the police

should be more concerned about how to protect our members than to be

extorting money from them.

“The fact that robbery had earlier happened at that spot around 3 am

today should have made the police to be on alert”, he said.

The Commissioner of Police, however, assured that investigations into

the matter has commenced in earnest, assuring that no efforts will be

spared to ensure that the security of the state, particularly places

identified as flashpoints would is fortified.

The Deputy Governor told the Commissioner of Police to deploy more

patrol teams to the Aramoko-Ijero and Aramoko –Igede axes that are

becoming dens for armed robbers in recent time and warn his men and

officers against unprofessional conducts.

Based on the issue raised by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr

Kehinde Odebunmi that some Fulani herdsmen were not only wreaking

havoc on valuable crops, but involving in robbery, Olusola urged the

security chiefs to treat all suspicious issues relating to robbery

holistically to ensure that peace is returned to the state.

“We want to appeal to the police to investigate the matter thoroughly

and bring the perpetrators to book. Our government is seriously

concerned because when life is lost, it gives the impression that

Ekiti is not secured.

“Our State has witnessed relative peace in the last seven months and

when the evil doers would like to come when they realize that a place

is peaceful. We should all be vigilant and cooperate with the police

to make Ekiti safe.

“I want to say that the police have been doing their best but they

need to be warned against unethical practices. It is like they are

smearing the image of the force and this should not be tolerated”, he

stated.

Assuring that the perpetrators of the dastardly act would be

unraveled, the security chiefs promised to redouble their efforts to

prevent influx of criminals into the state from the neighbouring

states."

The Oyo State Police Command on Wednesday said one person was killed when hoodlums clashed in Oja’ba area of Ibadan.

However, some of the residents of the area claimed six persons were killed during the clash.

Trouble began on Tuesday evening when a group named Idowu Boys, with support from Zaccheus Boys, threatened to attack an unnamed group.

A resident of the area said Idowu Boys and the unnamed group had engaged in a deadly street fight in the past.

The source said, “Idowu Boys said they had an unfinished business with the other group after a recent clash. The members said they would attack the group after joining forces with Zaccheus Boys on Tuesday evening, so there was commotion in the area. We had to close our shops and stayed indoors because of what happened in the past.

“From what I heard, Idowu Boys said the other group killed one of their members recently and that they were prepared to take their revenge on them. They ambushed them around Gege, leading to a fight that left three dead. We later heard that six persons eventually died in the clash.”

Another eyewitness said the hoodlums initially fought with broken bottles and sticks, but resorted to the use of guns and other weapons as the fight progressed.

The Public Relations Officer of the Oyo State Police Command, Adekunle Ajisebutu, said police had restored calm in the area.

He said, “Only one person died. The Commissioner of Police has ordered a 24-hour security coverage of the affected areas with a view to protecting lives and property. Some arrests have been made. Normalcy has returned.”

A clash between Uneme- Ekpedo and Bekuma- Okpameri communities in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State over mango, has re­portedly left two people dead.

Trouble was said to have started on Wednes­day, when one out of four people from Uneme- Ekpedo community, who had gone to the bush to pluck mangoes, was killed by persons sus­pected to be members of Bekuma-Opkamere after an attack.

Consequently, youths from Uneme-Ekpedo community were said to have mobilised and at­tacked Bekuma-Okpa­meri, setting houses on fire and attacking resi­dents.

It was learnt that over 40 houses, including the palace of the Oba of Be­kuma-Okpameri, HRH Oba Moses Alabi, were set on fire, while scores of people, who were wounded are now receiv­ing medical treatment at hospitals.

Witnesses said, follow­ing the clash, residents of Bekuma-Okpameri have fled their community and are now camped at a makeshift for Internally Displaced Person (IDP) in Lampese in the same local government.

“As I’m talking to you now, there is nobody in Bekuma-Okpameri. It was unbelievable. The youths have completely sacked the community and resi­dents are now camped in Lampese,” a member of a fact-finding team sent to the communities said.

It was further learnt that the persons who commit­ted the crime that led to the arson on the Bekuma-Ok­pameri were neither from the community nor from Uneme-Ekpedo.

A bloody exchange of gunfire between some operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and suspected Niger Delta militants has led to the death of three members of the gang and left two officials of the Corps injured.

During the incident which took place along Snake Creeks in Nembe, Bayelsa State, many of the suspected hoodlums, who reportedly attacked the armed NSCDC personnel were said to have fled with gunshot injuries.

Security operatives have recently become the targets of militants and sea pirates in the Niger Delta region, leading to the death of at least 10 soldiers and naval officers in the last one month.

Confirming the latest attack, Mr Desmond Agu, Commandant of the NSCDC in the state, noted that his men were on patrol when they came under fire from the suspected criminals.

‘’ NSCDC personnel while on patrol along Snake Creek within Nembe Creeks came under heavy attack from the criminals operating along that axis. After the ensuing gun battle, three of the assailants were killed while the rest escaped with gunshot injuries.

‘’ Two NSCDC personnel sustained minor gunshot injuries but have been treated and discharged from the Federal Medical Centre, Yenagoa”, Agu said yesterday.

On the security threats posed by the recent upsurge in the activities of the militants and fears that oil production in the region might end if the attacks continue, Agu stated that the NSCDC and the other security agencies were working seriously to ensure that threats are minimised.

‘’The militants cannot take over the creeks because that’s not possible. The nation belongs to all of us. We are talking about protecting Nigeria’s critical assets. We will make sure that in collaboration with the other agencies, the pipelines and other assets are protected.

‘’We are ensuring that this thing is minimised so that Nigeria will breathe. Nigeria depends largely on oil. On the destruction of pipelines, we are at red alert”, he added.

– The deputy governor of Cross River has been taken hostage asides others

– Neglecting the Bakassi returnees is said to be the grievance of the militants

Some gunmen suspected to be militants have reportedly attacked the Cross River state governor’s office in Calabar the state capital.

There are speculations that the Bakassi militant group stormed the Cross River governor’s office.

Reports suggest that over 20 suspected Bakassi militants on Friday, July1 invaded the office to apparently express anger over alleged abandonment of the Bakassi returnees by the government.

Investigations reveal that the group arrived the state’s seat of power shortly after the Deputy Governor, Ivara Esu, reported for duties.

A source, who pleaded not to be named because she is not authorized to speak on the matter, said the suspected militants invaded the Government House at about 10am and for several hours held Mr Esu and the staff hostage.

According to the source, the daredevil militants boldly told the people that they belonged to the Bakassi Volunteer Force.

It’s leader, who gave his name as “Capon,” boasted that his group were out to compel the government to release their monthly amnesty stipend, which has been withheld for several months.

He noted that the decision to stage the blockade was unanimously taken by the group to draw global attention to the deplorable way the Bakassi indigenes had been treated by the present administration in the state and country.

The Capon insisted that Bakassi people, who were displaced when Nigeria handed over their ancestral homes to the Republic of Cameroon, were being treated like slaves by government.

He explained that the group had in the past made several efforts to dialogue with the government but said the governor showed no interest in dealing with the problem facing them.

“Our people are dying hopelessly on a daily basis due to minor ailments that could have easily been treated. We have made attempts to dialogue with the governor several times but he would not give us audience and that is why we are here to demand our little stipend,” he said.

“We are from the Bakassi Volunteer Force, who have been neglected by government. Our people are dying yet the government is not doing anything. We decided to come out here today to let the entire world know what is happening so when we apply violence against the government nobody will blame us.

“Before the Bakassi Peninsula was handed over to Cameron, both the state and the federal governments benefitted from the proceeds of oil and other business activities from that place. After our homes were handed over, we are treated like strangers in our own land.

“If the federal government has rejected us, we won’t allow our own state too to reject us. We will shut down the governor’s office if nothing is done in the next few days.”

Premium Times reports that when contacted, the Chief press secretary to the Governor, Christian Ita, confirmed the invasion by the militants. He said the group was there to express their plight to government but did not disrupt administrative duty.

He added that the state Security Adviser, Jude Ngaji, had addressed the aggrieved group while promising to contact the Amnesty office in Abuja.

By Chimaobi Nwaiwu, Nnewi

Gunmen operating on motor cycle shot dead two persons in Okpuno, Abor Akauzor, Umusioma village in Nkpor Idemili North local government area of Anambra State, threw one inside a well and left another with gunshot wounds.

The dead victims, identified as Uzochukwu Ezeme, a vigilante operative; Chibuzor Ajaetu, a beer parlour operator, and a 34-year-old trader, were said to have met their death when the gun men opened fire on them killing two instantly and throwing the third inside a well where he died.

Tears flowed freely in the village, yesterday, when the decomposing body of the victim thrown into the well when the incident happened last Wednesday was recovered.

Ibegbulam, another victim of the attack, receiving treatment in a hospital at Nkpor, said he was attacked together with Ezeme in the village where they were doing vigilante work by the gunmen who opened fire on them.

Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Nkiru Nwode, confirmed the incident, saying it happened on Wednesday at about 10 pm, adding that it is a murder case and had been transferred to the state Criminal Investigation Department.

Meanwhile, a 52-year-old widow, Mrs Cecilia Nneamaka Otakpo, has petitioned the Inspector General of Police to investigate the murder of her son, Otakpo Franklin Chinedu, 19.

Chinedu was said to have been strangled and thrown into the River Niger, Onitsha on March 22, 2016 by suspected thugs.

The widow, through a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Amaenyi village, Awka, Mr. Nweke Jonas, also petitioned Anambra State governor, Dr. Willie Obiano, on the matter.

In the petition to the governor, Jonas decried the activities of a group engaged to collect internally generated revenue (IGR) of tricycles (keke) by the state government which he linked to the killing and urged Obiano to intervene.

In another petition to the state Police Commissioner, dated October 28, 2016, the lawyer of the Grand Patron of the Association of Tricycle Operators, Owners and Dealers, Anambra State, Wilfred Ezike, threatened to go to court to pray the court for an order of mandamus to compel the police to do their work on the alleged murder.
